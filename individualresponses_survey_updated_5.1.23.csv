Because a parent doesn't advocate for their child to receive a 1 on 1 or the district refuses, the staff and other students suffer. It becomes a stressful and understaffed environment that does not allow the equity in education that each student deserves. The school/district should advocate for the class as a whole and make sure that if one student needs the majority of the help available, it doesn't take from the rest of the students.

I continually see students with incredible emotional/mental disabilities in general education classrooms with very little support. While I believe in inclusion, many of these students take away from the learning of the rest of the class on a regular basis. Classrooms are evacuated (why is this one child not evacuated), learning is disrupted, the rest of the class is terrified, etc.  Why does safety and learning take the backseat to a student who OBVIOUSLY needs a different placement.  We have WAY too many students like this in our district.  This needs to be resolved and classrooms need to be designed or created for students with these types of special needs.

Yes,Yes,School administrator,,,,High school (grades 9-12),"I would like to know how my Sped Teachers can get timely responses to specific questions.  What I am told by them is that they often email and call, never getting Hayley but getting someone who does not know the answer and then people don't get back to them OR they are told they were trained on this date and give reference to a specific slide in a slideshow.  I reiterate again, this is not training or professional development.","When I have attended meetings with Hayley, she is often in ""cover her rearend"" mode, proving she gave this training or that training (which to her is a slideshow or checklist).  She does not know how to do her job and should not be in that position.  It seems to always be about sending responsibility to someone else, like an administrator, to do her job.  I never had issues like this when we had someone like Tim Garbrech doing the position.  Hayley is argumentative and condescending to staff.  In my experience, previous people in this position looked for solutions and ways to work together - Hayley looks to cover her self and blame others.   When she is confronted with facts, like the coordinated effort I saw at various boardmeetings, rather than take responsibility, she acts like she was treated unfairly. ","We need sufficient staffing, especially for special education students.  When concerns are brought before the board, the way I saw so many Sped Teachers eloquently bring their factual concerns, it would have been great to see more action than a listening session (which was not taken seriously be Hayley and her teammates as evidenced by their smiles and snickers ).  ",We are losing so may excellent special education district level personnel due to Hayley's incompetence and bullying behavior.  She should not be in this position.  It is her direct lack of leadership and poor special education program knowledge which has allowed this to happen.  We once had a very strong program and the best people are being stolen to other districts.,"There are so many special education teachers in the district who are fabulous at their jobs.  If those superstars were allowed to mentor other teachers, and help them write their IEPs things would improve. ","Using slideshows and handouts/checklists that have been directly taken almost word for word from districts out of state and calling them original creations of Hayley as well as citing case law from another state which has little relevance to us but is being used as a way to force teachers to ammend IEPs is not appropriate. We need Special Education Leaders who know what they are doing and who are willing to put in the work to hire strong people, not followers of the bullies in the department.   Additionally, the special education memo is horrible and not helpful to my teachers.  They seem more like ways to ""prove"" they have given enough information to say that leadership did their job, rather than to actually train staff to do their best work.",Replace the district leadership in the special education department - starting with Hayley.

This decision-making started at the beginning of the current school year, when the district began offering transportation to ECEAP students, the majority of whom do not have IEPs.

Of course, that isn't a surprise to me considering that the job of district representative has been pushed off on school administrators and there hasn't been much on-site connection to the families/needs of the individual programs as there had been under previous leadership in Student Services. If you don't come see the programs (possibly because you're too busy micromanaging everything else) then it's difficult to connect the best program to an individual's needs....which of course should be in each IEP.","We have a FABULOUS staff who cares deeply for all of our students! Every single staff member here does their very best to connect with students and families, no matter what their needs are. The hinderance is students who clearly have been placed into the incorrect program for their needs, in order to make things easier at the district/department level.","The barriers to a positive culture within a building lies strictly with the district and the decisions that are made at that level. Many times there is lack of communication, lack of response, lack of knowledge for the program and students we serve and honestly what feels like a lack of interest in our community and our student's needs. It seems like things just get rubber stamped and pushed along without proper input from involved parties.","District level - Actually, very few! Knowing who to contact and believing that the person you are reaching out to has the information you are seeking is not happening very frequently. This has been greatly lacking at the district level because so many knowledgeable staff members have left this toxic work environment for their own wellbeing. Incoming people are not being trained and do not have any idea about the types of programs they are supposed to be supporting....or even running. The response time is a joke. Many time it will be multiple days before we hear back from someone and even then decisions are not being made or communicated because they just don't know what they are doing.  ","District level - Unfortunately, once decisions are outside of our control, then things get much less positive and much more bogged down, many times with people who don't know (and I believe who don't CARE to know our students and families). The lack of connections to our programs, staff, students and families by the department whose mission it is to advocate and protect the education of student with the most needs is shameful. The disfunction in Student Services in the past few years has been an embarrassment to what was once one of the strongest special education departments in the state of Washington. Many times they don't know enough about our school programs and needs and when they try to act like they're knowledgeable its just embarrassing. It feels like their lack of care for about the different programs blatantly shines through. Honestly, it is difficult to watch and extremely hard to try to make excuses to families for the lack of communication and how long the process for correct placement takes. ","Remove the current ""leadership"" in Student Services and investigate fully previous allegations against her for an abusive work environment (take a look at the number of people who have left that department in the past few years that she's been there). Get rid of many of the mid-level management people who seem to do a lot of paper pushing and not much actual contact with families. (currently not certain if they all have the proper credentials for the jobs they are being paid to perform.) Go back to the previous process of knowing the program needs and assigning students to those correct classrooms to best serve their needs....not just the closest school to their home address. Better communication between program levels (Preschool>Elem, Elem>Middle, Middle>High, High>Age 21) to help with student transitions. Job-a-likes for teachers and staff that are actually beneficial and relevant to the needs of their students. Expect the staff that is paid to ""manage"" these programs to actually do that work. If they showed up in buildings and really knew the families they serve, then perhaps they would better communicate with them.   Someone seriously needs to look at FAPE and if it has been adequately provided to ALL of our students in the past few years. As far as I can tell, we have a number of families who could file lawsuits for lack of access and lack of service time compared to what is on their IEPs.  "
Yes,Yes,General education teacher,,,,High school (grades 9-12),Differentiation of curriculum INCLUDING time to do so within the PD,"In our school, we have certain teachers who have classes heavily loaded with students with 504s and IEPs. When we talk to IEP managers, it appears they handpick teachers who differentiate and are making the appropriate accommodations for students. This leads to an environment where some teachers are overloaded and then have a difficult time fulfilling student accommodations because they have more students to accommodate then is possible. When we ask counselors to balance classes, they say it is too difficult to move schedules or a student will not be successful in specific classrooms which leads to non-equitable classrooms for all students and the teacher. ","Being given clear understanding of a student's accommodations when they enter the classroom; making sure that teachers who are not differentiating are given strategies for differentiating instead of overloading the classrooms of teachers who are supplying appropriate accommodations to students. It is unrealistic to ask a teacher to meet 32 students where they are at when 20 of those students require accommodations. In some cases, it is physically impossible to fulfill accommodations around seating. A curriculum with differentiated reading levels would also be helpful. Students are kind to one another and there is active inclusivity in assemblies and other activities around the school. ","Not having books for different reading levels; not having an up-to-date curriculum; creating classrooms where teachers have to give all their time to students with IEPs (as they should if needed) because classes are unbalanced and we end up with tracked classrooms; learning support teachers handpicking the teachers their students get, overloading those classrooms and leading to teacher burnout, as well as not allowing other students who selected those classes (for electives) to be in the class because there aren't enough students for another section and the class was picked because the teacher is really great at accommodating students; having 20 students with IEPs and accommodations in a class of 32.",Let us know what is happening before it is happening. ,"The system is broken. We aren't receiving messages about students being put into our classroom throughout the year. We don't know what our class load will look like until we look and count and receive the IEPs. When a student is put in our classroom after the beginning of the year, we do not receive an IEP until we ask for it, sometimes asking multiple times. It would be really great if that was something we could access through Skyward. When a student isn't successful in a course, we put them in another teacher's classroom (without telling the teacher in advance - the teacher losing the student or gaining a new one). Instead of working through issues, we just move students which is not productive and does not teach any kind of accountability. I understand why this might be necessary in some cases, but this appears to be the norm. ",Make IEPs accessible in Skyward (or IEP at a glance).

","I am assuming that when you say ""student placement"", you are referring to the classes that they are placed in following a diagnosis.  With that in mind, I strongly disagree that there is any thought to placement.  Frankly, placement seems to be whatever is easiest for counselors.  Students are often moved around or placed on which teachers that admin knows will actually try and make meaningful effort and accommodations for those students and avoid placing them in classrooms where they know the teacher does little to no differentiation.  We also have many classes where there is a major imbalance in students with IEPS and 504's.  For example, there are nearly 10 sections of classes at my school that have HUGE imbalances and despite repeated requests to balance, nothing was ever done and no reason was given other than ""it is difficult to balance everyone's schedule.""  The result is that one teacher has 19 impacted students in their class while the other sections have on average 5 or less.      ",I think there are a lot of individuals who hold a lot of expertise but we are not on the same page as a staff.  So we have a number of potential facilitators but they are not in a position to help the barriers that I list in the next question.,"Right now, the biggest barrier that I can think of is that there are few opportunities for teachers and learning support staff to interact beyond IEP/504 meetings and rare staff meetings.  There is a growing tension and sense of antagonism between these two groups as a result of the increasing demands placed on both groups and I am very concerned that unless something is done to help facilitate more positive dialogue between us, we are headed towards yet another negative workplace condition that we DO NOT need.  Admin and District staff need to intervene and we need to collectively redesign how we communicate and rebuild the bridges that connect us.  The current environment is ""teachers can't be trusted"" and ""counselors/admin don't consider teachers"" when they are writing 504 and IEP accommodations and it feels like it is getting worse as time goes on.  ","Honestly, I can't identify anything about the current system that I would consider effective at this point.","Our placement model, which I consider an element of ""communication"" for students into classes, is broken and unfair to teachers who do their best to meet the ever growing demand of students with disabilities.

Their IEP goals are obsolete and their academic instruction is minimal, and as a result- there is very little assessment data.",The principal cares deeply for the students in this program. ,"Students with behavioral disorders are allowed to be violent, throw and break things, yell profanities around younger children, behave in destructive ways, physically attack staff members, etc. and there seems to be little to no consequence for these actions. Many students are in fear when they come to school because of what they've seen and some adults are as well. There is no consistency with expectations nor is there a systemic approach to improving these behaviors. There is little, if any, discussion about how to handle these incidents if you encounter one - which actually happened to me today. The school climate and staff morale is negatively impacted by this. Many staff members have voiced a desire to leave the school and/or district due to the daily impact this has on morale. ","Unfortunately, I can't think of examples of effective practices.","Behavior modification is ineffective, there is almost no communication with staff about daily incidents that impact staff and students, lack of training makes for ineffective staff, academic instruction for special ed is highly ineffective and almost non-existent for the IS program, overall management of IS is both inefficient and ineffective, newly hired SpEd district personnel who make program recommendations that disrupt regular ed classrooms, without understanding overall school needs, the school climate, talking with gen ed staff, etc. The inordinate amount of time our principal spends on the IS program diminishes the effectiveness of our overall school performance because the gen ed program is basically ignored. ",Schools with iS programs need to be staffed with Assistant Principals. Period. This person should be a liaison between the school and the district. There should be more regular opportunities for dialogue and providing feedback through surveys.

Yes,Yes,General education teacher,,Elementary school (grades Pre-K to 6),,,NONE,"After my school's entire team (grade level teachers, support staff, etc.) meets and places classes, the lists change drastically over the summer, without explanation.","-Consistent Sped/support groups (schedule and students) through the year. Group times change often, and kids are pulled during non-service academic blocks so they miss even more learning. Ex: Sped reading groups are pulled during class math time. Gen ed teachers often don't have common plan time to help with consistent pull-out schedules. Once schedules are set, and gen teachers adjust around support groups, the support group schedules change multiple times.   -Support services should begin in September, just like all other classes. Allow first 2-3 weeks for testing, with a testing schedule created before school starts. I wish gen ed teachers had a month or more to test and plan before teaching students!  -All Sped/support staff work together on a common schedule instead of beginning groups on different weeks, or developing a schedule mid-October.  -Sped/support groups should make desk schedule cards for the kids they serve. Gen ed teachers have to make these, and constantly update them when schedules change.   -Communication pathway/form for students needing multiple supports. Support staff should inform gen ed teachers if/when they communicate with parents, and share that task equitably.  -Designated staff to provide daily support for student needs, and enough for adequate support. Ex: our school needs primary and intermediate behavior support, not one person doing many jobs, and often not available.  -Students with extreme behaviors often significantly impact entire classrooms. We need daily para help with these students, including subs, and the ability to remove extremely disruptive students.  -More EBD staff, programs, and services.  -More language services and support. Most parents are still not using ParentSquare, and ML families need access training and help, which often falls (again) to the gen ed teacher. It's not well set up for teachers to easily use like Gmail is, and we don't have time to learn all of the features. ML staff need to help with family communication.  -Accountability for parents. Kids cannot learn if they are absent a lot, or if parents don't communicate. Gen ed teachers are held accountable for too many things beyond our control, including attendance, behavior, and work/academic performance, even if students are in the Sped umbrella. De-emphasize those things, or put the accountability on the parents, and on support staff also serving students as well.   -Hold Sped/support staff responsible for the same job responsibilities that gen ed teachers have, or allow gen ed teachers job-alike/indirect service weeks or sub time. Ex: Sped/support staff don't usually have to plan or present as much at curriculum night, they don't have kids during assemblies and other in-school special events, they can design their own schedules/lunches for common plan time, and they only teach a few kids at a time. They don't have to do regular classroom newsletters, field trips, or other activities not related to directly serving students.   ","-Constant interruptions to consistent student learning and schedules (indirect service weeks, job-alikes, changing schedules, testing...)  -Sped staff get extra time for planning, assessing, IEPs, etc. where their students remain in the gen ed class. Gen ed teachers have the same (and more) responsibilities with NO designated non-student time, except for the district non-student days we all get.   -Gen ed teachers are often asked to provide lessons/work for Sped kids whether push-in or pull-out. There should be a centralized, differentiated curriculum for every support program/student, and assessments for same.   -The Sped referral process creates a huge burden for referring teachers, and does not serve kids who need immediate interventions. Our school's eval team only meets once per month, and there are so many forms, records, observations, and ineffective 'pre-eval' team meetings to do first, that it's almost impossible to get a student timely Sped support. And, if the process is not fully completed in June, the next year's teacher has to start all over again with the full process. This is unfair to teachers and to students needing help.  -Counselors do not provide enough 1:1 or small-group support - I only see a counselor once a month for the class lesson. Maybe each school should have a full-time counselor and a floating one for larger schools/needs?  -Accountability for staff providing Sped/support services. I don't know what the family liaison person even does at my school, and when I've asked for support, it doesn't happen.  -Extensive Title, Sped, and ML testing during the year disrupts the learning schedule. That's in addition to the amount of time it takes to do all of the regular district testing.  -We can't meet the instructional minutes with so many interruptions (testing, assemblies, trainings, principal-directed whole-school events, students missing class for special 'positive behavior' events, health screenings, etc.). These things and more have been impacting instruction more and more. Lost learning time affects Sped kids more than ones at standard.  -Counselors teach monthly lessons, which is another 45-minute interruption to learning time, but lesson content is not always relevant to student/school needs. Peace rocks are fun, but I'd rather have kids learn how to disagree respectfully, solve small problems, and do some role-playing for things that actually happen at schools.  -Are Sped groups scheduled by grade level or by what level individual kids are performing at? If groups are scheduled by ability and not grade, it might be easier to flex the schedule.  -Sped groups are traveling the halls all day with no supervision. Many of these kids are very disruptive. There is no accountability or supervision. ","Emails that are timely, concise, and contain information helpful and relevant to teaching/learning. Reminder emails for the many, many tasks staff are required to complete. Email is very useful, and my families said they prefer email over ParentSquare. ","Our building's communication is terrible, and a result of poor leadership and toxic staff relations. The principal micro-manages everything, and often demonstrates passive-aggressive behavior. She does not listen to suggestions or concerns equitably, and often applies pressure-driven tactics to force compliance. We are overwhelmed with required and non-essential responsibilities, many at the whim of the principal. Staff are afraid of voicing concerns or suggestions due to retaliation. Communication is sporadic, ineffective, and often contradictory. This principal often employs deceitful tactics when concerns are brought up. Building-wide concerns, such as an unsafe dismissal procedure, have been ignored or trivialized for the 2nd year now. Few staff sit on committees because our voices are not heard. The principal micro-manages all committee work, and overrides group suggestions/ideas often. When staff follow the adult problem-solving process to address concerns, they are shamed or shunned by other staff, and the principal does not provide support or effective resolution methods. If a staff member persists in addressing a concern, there are retaliatory tactics (multiple involuntary moves, etc.). The staff newsletter is emailed at random times, and is very, very long. Much of the information is non-essential, or shows data that compares staff performance to one another. Ex: how many ParentSquare messages are send by each teacher, who is/isn't meeting iReady minutes (including reading minutes that the principal added to the SIP plan without informing staff), and attendance data (which is beyond our control). The advice for those having difficulty meeting all of these expectations? Ask someone who 'is' doing things right to see how it's done, or she'll (the principal) will meet and show us how to accomplish everything. The feeling at our building is that box-checking is more important than human relationships, or learning. My class doesn't even know what the principal looks like, and she does not attempt to form positive relationships with staff, especially people who bring concerns to her. She engages in argumentative emails with staff, and we receive dozens of emails throughout the year from her whenever she adds/updates her Google calendar. When staff brought the calendar concern to her, she continued the behavior, and added a note to the staff newsletter to be mindful of the emails we send HER because she can receive 'up to 100 emails a day'. Certain staff members receive favorable treatment, and are not held accountable for following building/district guidelines. If a concern is brought to the principal about another staff member, the principal does not ask that person to follow the problem-solving process and attempt to resolve the problem directly with the source. This results in some staff members undermining others, which perpetuates the climate of mistrust here. She does not address specific concerns with some staff individually, like the teachers that continue to not supervise their classes during dismissal. Instead, she adds yet another whole-building expectation to the staff newsletter, which makes those of us managing our classes feel devalued and disrespected. When I reported bathroom vandalism coming from students in 2 specific classes, we all got told to use a bathroom sign-out chart instead of the principal addressing the issue with those 2 teachers. This type of situation happens often. The principal makes inappropriate comments, which she then denies, such as making disparaging comments about people with anxiety. If there is no witness or documentation, then she denies these behaviors. She does not provide positive recognition, other than vague newsletter/email comments like 'I value you'.

There have been no plans developed by school or district teams and no real guidance for Special Education teachers in managing student behaviors that significantly impact their learning and the learning of others.   Decisions are NOT based on data or student need, but rather on where there is space in the district or school.  Resource Room teachers are called to manage behaviors around the school building, even when it takes time away from their lunch/planning/small groups.   Very little is communicated effectively with school teams.  Teachers are asked to go above and beyond to support individual students even when it means not teaching our other students.",Teachers and school staff work hard to ensure that all students are and feel safe and respected.

It would be beneficial for admin to be more involved.,"Admin do not communicate effectively with building staff.  At times when the office or admin are called to help with behavior, there is no response.   When helping to manage behaviors or monitor students who refuse to leave the Resource Room, Special Education teachers lose their lunch/planning/teaching time for other students (which decreases morale and positive culture).   Many negative behaviors eventually end up leading to students getting exactly what they want, which makes it more difficult to reduce or extinguish those behaviors down the road.  Administrators (principal) talk with staff (gossip) about other staff, which makes many staff close off and not talk about their concerns.  When approached with concerns, principal gets defensive and can act in retaliation.

Yes,Yes,"Related service provider, psychologist, or other certificated specialist",,,,High school (grades 9-12),"- Are standardized tests (particularly cognitive and academic achievement) a good way of identifying students for special education?   - Handling big behaviors (from big kids) at the secondary level.  - OSPI's recommendation for handling out-of-district transfer students with IEPs  - Group counseling (CBITS, DBT, teaching social skills, emotion regulation, etc.)","Placement decisions seem to fall more on the psychologist rather than district special education management and IEP teams. This should not be the case. This seems to particularly happen in both out-of-district transfer situations and in initial evaluations in the building.     Parent preference seems to be a big player in placement decisions. They should definitely have voice in the decision. Our model of ""customer service"" can put us in difficult situations where parents feel like they get to make final decision, even if that is against what the student's needs are (as defined by the evaluation and IEP). Similarly, it is not just the building admin that get to make these decisions. They don't always seem to know that and will find other ways (e.g., emergency expulsion or in-school-suspension) to dictate how placement decisions are made. ","- Keeping school psychologists in some sort of counseling role. At secondary, that typically looks like Behavior Consultation.     - Behavior Specialists write the FBAs. Sped teachers should know that they write and implement the BIPs.    - Classroom lessons provided by specialists (psychs, SLPs, etc) to Resource and/or Intensive Support classes. This does not currently happen and I think would be a neat addition to our roles. Finding the time for this is really difficult though.    - More mental health people here (psychs, social workers, counselors). ","- Communication and transparency between buildings and district management. Some of our district managers like to make decisions about how our jobs should be done without consulting the people actually in the jobs. When they do ""consult"" the people, it seems to be a cover-up. They make up their minds before they even hear concerns. Then they ""hear"" the concerns, but don't do anything about it.     - Sped teaching management needs to (somehow) be more available to answer questions from teachers and specialists. We often can't do our jobs well if we can't get help from people who are supposed to know more than us. Be that about programs across the district, IEPOL, legal questions, Safety Net IEPs, etc.    - Change to DET meetings (Disability Evaluation Team) that are only for the team. No parents, students, etc., just sped teachers and specialists. Teams across the district seem to struggle with these. Help us fix them.    - Life Skills students having more gen.ed time. Even for social. Our IS teacher guards those students.     - IEP teams and sped management need to determine placement. It often falls, incorrectly, on the psychologist.     - Barriers to a positive climate and culture: Dana and Hayley",A lot of communication in the building. We all keep each other fairly well apprised to what's happening which is great. ,"- The school psychologist often bridges the communication between counselors/social workers to special education. Finding ways to take out the middle person.     - Counselors don't often want to work with special education students, particularly life skills students. But all students are gen.ed students first. This makes it harder for special education personnel.     - Some gen.ed teachers are amazing. Others really do not honor a student's IEP/504 accommodations. It feels like teachers get to say ""I was following their accommodations"" and that's the end of the accountability for them. It is the students who suffer, even though some teachers are not holding up their end of the deal. ","Management needs to be advocates for their respective teams. Sped teaching management need to be better advocates for the special education teachers. Sped specialist management need to be better advocates for their constituents (e.g., psychs, SLPs, OTs, PTs, audiologists, BCBAs). Right now, it feels like district management is against teachers and specialists. When we don't have strong voices acting as our advocates at the district level, we have to get a lot louder and more and more frustrated for district management to hear us.

We need fences at Woodway campus as 3-5 year old students with special needs are running into the street, woods, off the recess area since the upper management ""doesn't believe in fences"" and children will ""learn to stay with the group"".  The Woodway and AECC pre-k campuses are not equitable with regard to learning spaces outside the classroom (e.g. there is only a tiny sensorymotor room at Woodway for 14 classes while there are 5 giant spaces at AECC that are indoors).  We do not have adequate para educator support for special education classrooms and it is always really challenging, especially in the beginning of the school year.    "

These students are often on their Chromebooks playing games/watching videos, or ""on breaks"" walking around the school. They are not learning anything and teachers don't have the time or resources to put together academic lesson plans because there are not enough paras to allow the teachers to take a step back and get their bearings and lesson plan. Likewise there is not guidance/framework from the district on what/how academics should be incorporated into the ISES program.     The ISES programs are failing the students and it is so depressing to see. These children are not provided a safe, constructive place to grow and learn academically or behaviorally/emotionally.

Further, the substitute para rate of pay is terribly insufficient.  No matter that this district is ""around average"" of other nearby school districts.  They are all dismal.

There are NOT enough ""peer models"" for all of the students who have already-identified special needs or who have going-to-soon-be identified special needs.

These may not be disabilities or developmental delays, but are important to take in to consideration none-the-less.  ACEs impact the student (and also the classroom).    Therefore a model of 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 is No Good.  A better preschool model would be:  1/4, 1/4, 1/2 (That is:  1/4 students already on IEPs, 1/4 ECEAP students, and 1/2 ""community"" students.)

My school has students with challenging and explosive behaviors and we do not have any of those resources and we will have to evacuate the classroom or use mats and then the other students are not getting their needs met.

In addition, I know of at least one teacher at my school last year (there were a few others in similar situations) who had 2 severely impacted students (students physically hurting other kids, screaming profanities and threats daily, causing classrooms to be evacuated) and it was said right off the bat that they would not change the placement of 2 students from one classroom. This is a clear example of not using the data, and in the meantime, it genuinely traumatized the entire classroom of students that year. The students who needed a change of placement did not get any learning done, nor did the rest of the class. How is that these students' least restrictive environment? And if the need is there, why do we not have more programs in place for students who would thrive in a smaller classroom environment with more structures and adult support in place? This is a huge need and it is impacting whole classrooms of students.     If we care about students and their success, this needs to be more of a priority. ","This biggest one is giving more special education support staff so that we can effectively meet the needs of students. Currently we do not have enough adults to help students in need, and it has a huge impact on a positive climate and culture related to special education.     Getting a system in place that streamlines evaluating students in need quickly and efficiently. ","There are not enough staff members to support the needs of students. Because of the pandemic, many evaluations were put on hold even though they were needed. Now we are catching up and we need more special education staff so that we can support our students effectively. ",,"Having the school psychologist model makes it so that the psych who does all the evaluations is also needed to support students in counseling. We need both - folks who do the evaluations and paperwork end of things, and folks who support students in the day-to-day with mental health, behavior, etc. It's not possible for one human to do both with the level of need that we are seeing. ","More transparency. Having a way for staff members who are in schools working directly with students to communicate with leadership. There is a HUGE disconnect - I have seen our assistant superintendent maybe once for 1-2 minutes in the past 2 years. That is not okay. Our district leaders need to be on the ground in schools daily so they understand what schools are going through and can have the whole picture. Communication goes both ways, and currently there is not a system in place for staff members to have a communication line to their leaders. This impacts everything and would reduce the top-down decision making/communication approach that we are currently seeing from our district leadership.     I hope we can take this opportunity to truly look at the practices of our district and make some real improvements. Thanks for providing this survey. "
Yes,Yes,"Related service provider, psychologist, or other certificated specialist",,,,High school (grades 9-12),"Collaborating with other departments to appropriately place and best serve Multilingual Learners (ML) and students with disabilities (i.e., include ML teachers and gen ed teachers. Not just sped teachers and itinerant staff)","Teachers (primarily gen ed but also some SPED), counselors, and principals OFTEN do not fully understand why a student will not qualify for SPED services, nor do they have the time for those of us in SPED to explain. This causes a lot of challenges in accurately placing students (such as in gen ed multilingual learner/ML courses versus qualifying for SPED) which causes over-identification of ML students in SPED.   A positive - Our new-ish director of Diversity Equity and Inclusion, Dr. Vergara, truly seems to be working with us (SLPs) to accurately place students. Dr. Vergara has said he's working to create a more robust ML program which will help us (ML teachers, SPED teachers, SLPs, Psychologists) to be able to collaborate and learn from each other about WHY students cannot be qualified for SPED. That yes, they might need help, but SPED services are not for help; they are for special needs. This has been a very difficult area and has become a great passion of mine.    Parents/guardians may not be told the correct process for qualifying for SPED services largely due to principals and gen ed teachers and counselors not fully understanding the process. Typically, students should first be brought to the attention of counselors by parents or teachers, discussed at Problem Solving Teams (aka Student Support/Study Teams or now Multi-tiered Systems of Support teams) which includes a psychologist who can then determine, after learning more about the student and the supports that have been provided in the classroom, if the student might need to be referred for an evaluation for SPED. If the student is ML, there are additional steps such as including the SLP in completing a Critical Data Matrix. Many staff and parents do not know about any of this, or they seem to forget and will just immediately refer for an evaluation, in writing, which begins the evaluation timeline.    Placement decisions are not always team decisions based on the student's needs. Take, for example, one case last school year in which one of our assistant principals unilaterally and illegally changed the student's class schedule against what the rest of IEP team was recommending causing cascading negative events which ultimately resulted in the parents filing a complaint with OSPI that caused the district extra $$ and made the student's team look like utter failures (myself included). His wife, Hayley Etnier, appeared to cover his mistake.    Placement decisions are not consistent across the district. It appears that each school does what and how they want because our SPED director Hayley Etnier is a terrible communicator who does not accept constructive criticism leading to no one knowing what to do or how to do it. In my opinion, she never should have been hired in our district let alone as a director.","The psychologist that I work with most frequently at my high school is absolutely amazing both as a professional and as a person. She promotes a positive climate and culture that is also equitable.     Most of our Equity team members show that they truly care about our students and are working to improve our high school climate and culture.    Also, two itinerant staff members who share an office with me - we are all SPED - promote a positive climate and culture. Without them, and the above mentioned psychologist (and my SLA team which of course isn't at my school), I would very likely not be able to stay in this district because of the toxic climate and culture that Dana Geaslen and Hayley Etnier have reduced this district to in the past 3-4 years. It's ridiculously depressing. Depressing how many seriously talented, supportive, and devoted-to-students SPED managers that we lost, last year alone, because of Dana and Hayley. It's depressing and incredibly embarrassing.","The conflict of interest that is the Etnier couple - one a SPED director (now/this year of secondary schools only) and the other an assistant principal of the secondary school where I work.    Siloing of departments (though this is primarily a district-wide issue) and Classified versus Certificated staff members. Classified staff (and OFFICE STAFF - I have asked for this for years) need training in inclusivity, anything SPED-related to better support our students. As an example, there is at least one office staff member who repeatedly and loudly talked negatively about SPED students as well as students who are not the same as her (white, cis gendered, heterosexual, etc) in the main office, no less, and despite my attempts as well as talking with the principal at the time about these occurrences, continued to make such comments and likely still does.    If we (psychs, SLPs, SPED teachers, and ML teachers) could have a top-down requirement (previously attempted a bottom-up approach with limited success in part due to the pandemic) that focuses on collaboration and education about each other's jobs, SPED & ML qualifications and dismissal criteria, our ML students would greatly benefit. And our gen ed teachers NEED more information about how students qualify for SPED, why they wouldn't qualify for SPED, why they should be in ML classes instead of SPED, etc - gen ed teachers aren't completely to blame for all the referrals. They need support, too, and our SPED director(s) should be working with Dr. Vergara and others about how we can do that, so we can more effectively reduce over-identification of ML students in SPED.    I'd also LOVE to see more ML classes at secondary (science, history, math, etc), so they aren't immediately referred for SPED when they aren't functioning at expected levels of English-only speaking students.","Job alike meetings.    SPED newsletter? It needs a lot of tweaking to make it more effective for more people. I have sent in suggestions for improvement without response from Hayley Etnier. However, when it's sent (it's been a few months and it's supposed to be monthly) it is nice to have all SPED staff receive the same information. That said, there are still many, many confusing communications that come from SPED director/special services leadership/etc despite the newsletter info.    ",Inconsistent communication and inconsistent information from the SPED director/her team.    Siloing of departments - rare or nonexistent communication amongst SPED and Gen Ed as well as amongst SPED teams. Hayley Etnier has not been a proponent of including Itinerant Support Services Department (ISSD) in SPED communications. She silos SPED teachers from ISSD. She treats us/ISSD as though we're not SPED and our (20-22 ISSD admin included) participation and thoughts don't matter in SPED conversation/decisions.,"Consistency, consistency, consistency. Our students need it and so do we!    Hayley Etnier needs to work on accepting constructive criticism, especially those which will/may improve SPED practices, rather than pout and give the person who gave her constructive criticism the cold shoulder.    Communicating at all, especially when someone contacts them. Hayley Etnier has not responded to emails I've sent about a legal case.    Not necessarily communication, but Follow Through. I have yet to hear about Hayley Etnier following through on something she said she would do regarding a legal situation at the beginning of this school year. I've reminded her and the IEP team multiple times. Asst. Sup. Dana Geaslen has even asked for information from Hayley with no response from Hayley (unless she responded and did not include me).     If Hayley Etnier weren't at Edmonds School District, I think communication would improve."

Additional PD in culturally affirming and responsive teaching practices is necessary to help our students receiving special education but also, to not misdiagnose students who are capable in a gen ed setting without services. ","Parent preference and influence at my school often influences decisions to get students extra services to ensure success, and not just access. ",Our special education teachers are amazing. They go above and beyond their job description and contract hours to communicate with staff and families of students. ,"There is a lack of time for gen ed teachers to collaborate with each other and special education teachers to develop strong supports for students in side the classroom. This is especially true in the 7-8 grades where students move between classrooms and teachers with varying supports. There is also a lack of time and understanding on how to provide inclusion opportunities for students in the Intensive Support or Life Skills classes, who are of middle school age, to push in or for students in the gen ed to participate in reverse inclusion where they push into the Intensive Support and Life Skills classes.

This makes no sense. Also, students shouldn't be placed in teacher's classrooms without their input. Someone in a different school is randomly placing students in all the inclusive preschool classrooms with no consultation. Teachers should be involved in the process of who is coming to their classrooms because they know their classroom dynamics. There was also a time when a student was placed in a classroom even after the evaluation team made recommendations for a different classroom. The student was moved to the recommended classroom after I insisted and problem solved for the placement. ","I think it is crucial that general education teachers be provided the tools needed to support students with learning disabilities in their classrooms. Often times these teachers are unaware and ill-prepared for students with IEPs. Especially now after the pandemic, students are facing alot of emotional disregulation, lack of social skills and have a harder time learning.

(We do not have students that can independently go to another classroom.) Lack of staff has meant lack of inclusive opportunities for our students.

We, as teachers, are expected to answer emails within 48 hours. We ask questions, through phone, email and voicemail, and NEVER get answers. We have administrators making placement decisions that have never even met the students they are placing. They do not listen to IEP teams. They dissolve entire, very important programs without reason. This creates chaos and unneccesary stress for our families. It creates IS programs with 16-20 students. Then, they expect case managers to communicate with families, even when dealing a harsh blow like a change in placement or not receiving needed services. It is not right.","We need to have actual face to face meetings with our SPED adminstrators. They need to answer questions. They need to know our students, our classrooms and our staff. Only then will they truly understand what is needed, and not ignore us as we advocate and plea for our students' needs."

In the past, the programs were slightly differentiated and students were placed in programs that fit their needs. This home school model has caused students to be put into classrooms that do not have the support they need. In addition, we had one classroom at each level  (primary, intermediate, middle school and high school) that focused on students who had significant disabilities and in addition had behavioral challenges (often aggressive), many were non-speaking, needed assistance toileting/wore pull-ups, and required close supervision due to eloping, pica, self-injurious behaviors, etc. At the end of the 2020-2021 school year, the primary classroom was dissolved. The very high-need students from that classroom were sent to the intensive support programs at their home school.  Teachers, though very competent, often were not trained on many of these behaviors, did not have materials at the appropriate instructional levels and did not have the required level of paraeducator support to not only insturect these stuents, but to keep these students, other students and staff safe.

Additional ALL staff training  (especially Paras) to support SEL.  Learning how to support student's with escalated behaviors.  Having more staff trained and available to step in to cover as needed within the various sped programs within a building.

Increased TOSA support to sped programs to help sped teachers with report cards, progress notes, scheduling, behavior support, etc.   3. District support for staffing (e.g. self-contained paras). To make sure the sped programs are fully staffed.   4. District support of daily whole team meting time so the teams can talk. Many of the paras seem to work 'bell to bell' and don't have enough time to meet with their whole team.

Much more SEL PD for all sped staff; including additional para training to help them learn how to support student's with escalated behaviors.  6. A pool of qualified behavior support paras that could fill in when there are staffing issues at a school (such as if teachers or paras out sick or injured).  ","1.

Not having a fully staffed sped program.  Often there are paras out sick (or injured on the job) with no sub available. That puts the whole team on 'fire fighting' mode and messes up the routines and schedules in place.    3. Paras who are not fully trained or are not well suited or not paid well for an incredibly difficult job.  4.

Yes,Yes,Other (please specify),"Title 1 reading interventionist, K-1 (in 2021-22)",Elementary school (grades Pre-K to 6),,,"As a former Resource teacher, I feel like I have quite a bit of training and experience regarding effective instruction and creating environments conducive to learning for students with disabilities. There is a great need for some basic info for gen ed teachers: what is SDI, FAPE, least restrictive environment, differentiated instruction. But I think the demands on gen ed teachers are just too great. They are under too much pressure to follow district scope/sequence and curriculum maps/schedules, with the goal of getting all students to meet standards. They may be told to address SEL but they aren't given enough support to make this happen. They are putting out fires (dealing with ongoing student behaviors) and don't have the time nor energy to easily incorporate changes.","There are cases at my school where placement decisions were influenced by parent preference or school location. (With the latter, the student has had big changes in being in and out of school so another placement was rejected because he's in 6th grade and the team knew there would be another transition in a year. )","Very dedicated gen ed teachers; Resource teacher with strong skills, vast knowledge, and overall good people skills; excellent para-eds in the Resource program; small but strong PTO","Lack of staff consistency in ISES classrooms; too much stress with two ISES classrooms in a school that moves in and out of high poverty status and has had a large increase in students served through the Resource room. It is not uncommon to have a student (served through SpEd) run through a hall, knock things over, or scream and yell obscenities. (This may also occur with a gen ed student, but is more common among SpEd students). Cedar Way has a number of students who have experienced trauma. These types of common, disruptive and sometimes violent behaviors negatively impact many classes.","We know our students have to be in a calm ""space"" to hear what someone is saying to them. Our staff must also be in a ""space"" to take in communication. So, regardless of the form, first support staff so they are in a position of mutual trust and respect. But to get back to the question, I think face-to-face is the most effective.","I don't know. Again, I think a lack of trust will make any type of communication ineffective. ","First of all, leadership has to be strong. I am no longer in SpEd, so the following is based on what I've heard my former SpEd colleagues say. I've heard Resource teachers had questions they e-mailed to a supervisor that went unanswered for weeks. I've also heard Resource teachers being confused of who was in charge of what (in terms of district leadership for SpEd) because of quite a few staff changes. I know the question is about improving communication practices, but if the leadership is ambivalent or weak, communication is likely to breakdown in meaning."
Yes,Yes,General education teacher,,Elementary school (grades Pre-K to 6),Middle school (grades 7-8),,"What exactly is the role of the special ed teacher, versus the gen ed teacher.",,"We are a close knit team with   expectations on how we interact with each other and communicate concerns. Because we work closely with our partners and our teams, and because we have low staff turnover and keep our kids in multi-age settings, it greatly adds to children not falling through the cracks. It truly is a family here at Madrona. ","Parents have this belief that a choice school means individualized learning. But that's not the case. We differentiate but unless they are on an iep, we cannot possibly individualize. While I agree that inclusion is important, too much is being put on gen-ed teachers. We have too many kids with varying needs. IEP need special ed teachers managing their learning. Realistically are special ed teachers are also overworked. There needs to be more Paris support to help them carry out the IEPs. Also it's frustrating when the communication the past couple years from the district was inconsistent. I feel like there have been many new folks in the leadership position with our superintendent and assistant superintendent as well as teaching and many do not know much about the district. I feel like folks have come in with a specific agenda. I feel like the it has become a Teachers vs. District mentality and we are constantly being micromanaged. There doesn't seem to be Trust From The District level. think it's difficult because in the past we've had families advocate for something and it doesn't align with our program. We have open concept classrooms and all windows, large class sizes with two teachers that team teach. Students who struggle with this setting or with the increased independent work that comes with it, sometimes have parents that push them to be at Madrona just because it's Madrona. I think that the loudest voices sometimes get their way and that's not fair.","Effective practices means that you listen to teachers and you work with a union. You do not manipulate parents with inconsistent messaging like at bargaining last year. Effective communication is trusting the knowledge in the room meaning there are people who have worked in this district for a very long time and instead of Reinventing the wheel, ask! Also it's important that everybody be on the same page.",Inconsistent communication or one leader saying one thing and another leader saying something else. Another form of ineffective communication is parents against teachers which is what I felt last year. The school district communication really made me feel like my job as a teacher was not important and we were not valued. I felt like so many of the messages were insulting to the effort and work we put in. ,"I feel like people in the district and I'm talking superintendent and assistant superintendents need to go into all of the schools and need to talk to the teachers. They need to understand the school climate. They need to understand what has happened in the past. They need to go back to a positive relationship. There is broken trust and that trust needs to be renewed with the teaching staff. There's no faith in District leadership right now with the assistant superintendent, superintendent and Teaching and Learning. I feel like the people who are running these departments are not in touch with what best practices are and what is doable in the classroom right now post pandemic. Encourage your staff. Don't put more on their plates."

Yes,Yes,School administrator,,Elementary school (grades Pre-K to 6),,,"There is not enough training for teachers in special ed and gen ed around behavior, behavior is communication, how to manage personal reactions and beliefs around behavior (i.e not take acting out personally). We need more opportunities (even at the building level) to make sure new Paras receive adequate training. In our specialized programs, on-site coaching with the behavior specialist would be ideal as well.","There is a belief that buildings and/or programs that ""scream"" the loudest get the most support. For the last two years the process around placement has been challenging both in regarding to transparency as well as timeliness and communication. We often felt blindsided. There is a need for more transparent communication and clarity. At times there are mixed messages (different people saying different things) and it is hard to know what is accurate.","These questions are broad and open-ended which make them a bit difficult. We work hard in our building to have a strong, positive school climate and culture.  Special education for us includes students who are primarily in gen ed but receives some support and our classrooms where students have significant disabilities. We work hard to include our students in self-contained classrooms in general education classrooms and reverse inclusion.  We will build on our work and challenge ourselves to get our students supported in general education classrooms. ","At times, staffing is challenging so it is hard to support students receiving special education services in the general education classroom (as compared to pull out services). Staffing is also a challenge for getting our students in self-contained classrooms into gen ed. Based on our students significant needs, they need an adult to accompany them to general education classrooms.  In addition, having the ability to do regular pd with Paras in both gen ed and special ed settings in order to help increase their skill would be an asset. We try to maximize our non-student days but this can be challenging. ","Overall, our school level communication is effective.      This year, I think there is effort at the district level to improve communication (clarity, timeliness). There are still challenges to overcome. ","Looking at the past two years and even to some disagree, this school year, district level communication practices have been flawed. There has been a lack of communication, mixed messages with communication and a general feeling of a lack of support. There were a lot of challenges due to Covid processes, a lot of turnover in the district (again, the word is the toxic culture that was at the ESC resulting in the loss of a lot of employees) and a lack of support to buildings when things were critical. Due to the nature of the challenges of the past couple of years, there is a lot of trust that needs to be rebuilt and safety restored.  I am aware of several administrators who are afraid to speak at meetings due to a fear of being yelled at later. This does not create a healthy work environment. ","Allow for true, open discourse that eliminates the fear of retaliation.  Clear, timely, transparent communication.  Allow building administrator input into decisions that impact them (this may be true for other departments but I don't know for sure.)    On a side note, one thing to consider with this survey is the challenge of blending the building with the district and not allowing space for additional comments or input or even a general comment section at the end of the survey.  It was also confusing at times to know if we are supposed to be answering only about last year or past two years or include this year.    From my perspective, the main take aways, which I am not sure my answers will indicate, is the need for a repair of harm. The past two years have been challenging in this district. Many building and department leaders have left their roles and this district due to the toxic climate. I am aware of leaders still contemplating leaving. There is a sense of fear of being able to speak up out of fear of retaliation. There is feeling of lack of district support when things are challenging. Staff are told ""the building has to handle it."" yet the building is not given the resources or the power to make these decisions. Until this climate issue is fully addressed and remedied, I worry about the continued loss of staff."

It's abundantly clear which principals are all in for their staff and which are hands off ""not my issue"" & pass the student off to the SInC (who sometimes isn't equipped to help but then doesn't have the support to ask for help).    There isn't clear classroom management from school to school.  Some rooms run like a circus, everyone flying by the seat of their pants; while others are so incredibly magical & expectations are clear for all.      I think the chaotic nature stems from a lack of investment at the district level that pours life-giving encouragement to teachers, particularly in IS rooms.  There are days where it's scary and exhausting being in a room.  I cannot imagine how unsupportive teachers & paras do the job day in and day out without proper supports.    I've been aware of students who have IEPs that allow them to wander the room...while other IEPs of similar students would never allow such disruptive behavior.

It is very clear that the ESD does not prioritize special education, it's teachers, paras or subs and as a result the administration does not or cannot see the importance these students, their families and staff have.  Outside resources are exorbitant, thus often forcing families to rely on public education which isn't being supported in a way that reflects the district's mission & vision statement.  It is hard for me to stomach that the district promotes we are building ""lifelong learners & responsible world citizens"" when basic classroom management and teacher/para support is lacking.

Yes,Yes,"Non-certificated support staff, including paraeducators",,,,,,,"I have been in a school where gen ed and special ed teachers worked together for the good of the student and it was a more positive climate.  Last year the Student Services admin team did not agree with or get along with each other very well.  The most toxic and negative staff left the district. I feel the Student Services admin team this year is friendly, helpful, works well together and is working on a common goal for the department. It's much easier to believe in your management team when they get along and work together for the common good.  I like that the Student Services admin team has implemented job alikes again on a regular basis to collaborate, answer questions and share information with building staff.   It seems this year Student Services admin are visiting programs in each school or meeting with teams more regularly to get to know individual sped staff and students.  Keep the lines of communication open between district staff and schools, transparency is important.   School staff need to keep in mind they should have a voice in decisions but can't direct every issue as district-level decisions are made with laws and the effects of their decision on all staff and students.  Remind everyone that most staff have positive intent.  Ask for help before you feel your situation is dire.    ",I feel that the special ed teachers and itinerant staff are unwilling to look at the positive changes the district special ed team is implementing this year and instead have a culture of continually finding fault and waiting for the district team to fail.   A barrier I see for this year is that Student Services directors and managers who left last year are still in contact with many current staff and still speaking negatively about the Student Services admin team so some staff members are focused on the negative and not looking for any positive.  Schools need to look at special ed as a part of their school and not just a program with difficult students they have to deal with.   Since COVID there has been a rise in difficult student behaviors in gen ed that have left even less capacity for staff to work with sped students that may have difficult behaviors.         ,Weekly Newsletters (searchable so you can go back and look things up)  Regular staff meetings with individual groups  All team emails   ,,

A student who cannot function in a large group does not benefit when pushed into an environment that only exacerbates their behaviors.  Plus as the student becomes more aware of their differences from peers, it only creates more tension.  Teachers find themselves spending a large percentage of time managing the student's behavior rather than teaching the whole class.  This is a different situation than physical disabilities.  ",Frequent meetings between special education and gen. ed. teachers to collaborate. Frequent meetings between parents and staff to communicate ongoing progress.,Not sure.,"Not sure, other than to invest more resources into training non certificated staff who support students with disabilities.  Right now, the training falls on the individual teachers, both spec. ed. and gen. ed. Often paraeducators come into the classroom with no training."
Yes,Yes,"Related service provider, psychologist, or other certificated specialist",,Elementary school (grades Pre-K to 6),,,"I think more training needs to be provided to general education teachers regarding how to support students with disabilities within the gen ed classroom environment. How to accommodate students, but also, how to provide a neurodiversity inclusive classroom environment. Professional development related to supporting emotion regulation would be incredibly helpful as we are seeing a lot of dysregulated students since returning from remote learning.","Under previous leadership I knew the process and it was followed fairly efficiently and with efficacy. I felt confident in being able to communicate the process to families and students were placed in programs that fit their needs in a timely manner. Since returning from remote learning the experience has been completely different. I do recognize that we have had a change in leadership and that the efficiency of procedures wasn't there and that for any new staff member there is a learning curve, so I did not anticipate that new administration would just seamlessly pick up where others had left off. That being said, I have not felt like a clear protocol has been provided by new administration and this is compounded by the fact that it is extremely difficult to speak with anyone at the district office. I know they are very busy and these are unprecedented times, but the lack of guidance is incredibly difficult.   The last few years students were placed in self-contained programs based on their location in their district instead of being based on need. While I understand the rationale to some extent (being closer to/connected to their community, shorter bus rides, etc.) I think it also increased the range of needs dramatically within our self-contained programs and made it more challenging to serve students effectively. There was at least one school where the principal was allowed to make placement decisions for the self-contained programs in their building, and several students from that school were placed in the self-contained programs there. Because there is no specific set of criteria for placement in a district program, this leads to inconsistency and subjective placements in my opinion. The recommendation for multiple students in my building has been to reduce their school day when they are presenting with behavioral dysregulation and we are initiating an evaluation. This does not seem equitable to me and does not seem data-driven, as it reduces the amount of instructional time we are able to provide for the student we already suspect of having a disability. To me, this feels like a denial of FAPE. I am frequently told at the building and district level that services/supports can not be provided to a student because ""we don't have the funding/staffing/etc.""). This does not take into consideration the needs of the individual student.",The teachers at my school are committed to supporting students and care about the students they are teaching. There is a commitment to professional development amongst most staff at my school. ,"We are incredibly understaffed and unprepared for the level of need at our school. Our special education staff have burnt out and there has been a high turnover rate amongst them which only adds to our lack of preparedness and ability to effectively collaborate and support students. We cannot get all the needs met in our building on a routine basis, let alone meet the needs of students when a crisis or escalation is happening. Our system is incredibly reactive at this point and we have many students who do not receive the specially designed instruction outlined on their IEP because we simply do not have the staffing allocated for it. We also do not have sufficient tier 2 interventions for students who do not receive special education services outside of Title 1 reading K-3 (sometimes 4). This means that students get to third grade and more pressure is placed on the special education system to provide instruction to students who are struggling because there is no other system available to the student outside of the general education classroom instruction. ",Email can be an effective method for general protocols and policies. Phone conversations are very effective when talking about individual student needs. ,"I think there may be not enough delegation or identification of who does what task. It feels like balls get dropped because there is a lot of waiting to find out who is going to do something/answer someone/decide something. This may be a product of having so many new administrators trying to figure out their place with one another. It feels like micromanaging may be happening. I don't have specific evidence of this, but the difficulty getting one clear answer from one person in a timely manner is incredibly problematic. It's also not uncommon to finally get someone on the phone to then get a response of ""Can I call you back in 10 minutes? Someone else is calling"" or ""Let me check in with ___ and then I'll get back to you."" In both cases, no one calls back. I think everyone is well intentioned, but perhaps they are understaffed as well given the increase in needs in special education in the last few years. ","This will sound flippant, but I just need someone to answer the phone when I call, and someone to be able to call me back within 24-48 hours. I don't call the district office frequently, but when I do, it's because I have come across a pretty pressing need and I either do not have the authority to make the decision at the building level, or I do not know how to proceed. If no one returns my call I am either stuck in a loop of trying to get ahold of them or there are multiple staff members trying to contact them for the same question, finally one member does get ahold of them, and then I have to rely on that person 1) knowing I also asked that question and 2) getting the answer to me. There are assumptions at the district level that we are all talking to one another within the building on a regular basis. If I called you, I just really need someone to return my call. Please do not return the call to my principal and assume that because you spoke to my principal he will let me know your response and that he is providing the same information to you that I would. Collaboration at the district level to the building sometimes means collaborating with multiple people within one building, but I feel this is key in order to make the best possible decisions for our students and have the best outcomes."

Because of this there have been many injuries. Our Sped classrooms are a lawsuit waiting to happen. The Sped depart needs better pay and more serious help for the Paras. The teachers need as much support as she can get. This support should come from the district in anyway that is needed. We should not be ignored! ,"Answer the phone. The schools are required to answer their phones for their cliental, the district departments should be required to answer their phone for their cliental, the schools. ",Ignoring people is not very effective. Procedures should be put in place so everyone is on the same page. If procedures are in place they should not be ignored. ,The Sped department needs to be available and visible. They should be visiting school when you have three paras injured in a week. They need to know what is happening in classrooms. Not just sped classrooms but all classrooms where students with IEP's are. We have one classroom right now that has 9 IEP's and the teacher has no extra help. 
Yes,Yes,General education teacher,,Elementary school (grades Pre-K to 6),,,"Student behavior, de-escalating students, how their IEP minutes are managed and enforced because often these minutes are not met with para and Sped teachers ""are not required"" to even attempt to find a guest teacher. Many IEP/SPED students are losing daily minutes and it is not productive or following the law. ","We are told that due to lack of support (we need more paras) many times students are grouped together to appease someone's schedule or to make scheduling easier. It is generally not adjust to meet student needs. When paras and SPED IEP managers are absent or cancel their groups, students with minutes are missing out. This impacts everyone and also does not support IEP students to reach their goals. Many times students are just placed in the classroom/settings out of what is easier for planning. We NEED more IEP support and these folks NEED to find guest teachers.     Also, these job-alikes mean that all IEP, Title groups are cancelled and this happens way too often.     There are too many assessments that take Title and IEP teachers weeks to complete, which in turn means more cancelled groups and loss of instruction and definitely not meeting IEP minutes.","More support for Gen Ed teachers. We are not trained to support SpEd students. However, the number of Sped students in classrooms is heavily increasing.     More training.     Less hoops to go through to get students support. Gen Ed teachers KNOW which students to move forward in the IEP process, yet our opinions are not valued and we must start with a bunch of hoops and more interventions. It takes too long to get students the support they deserve. ","Gen Ed teachers must find subs for their classes, yet IEP managers, Title teachers are Paras do not. In fact they don't even have to create plans or attempt to find a sub. This is not fair for students who thrive with the support we have identified.     To often Sped Teachers want to just ""go through the motions"" of the IEP process and not actually collaborate or listen to the gen ed teachers.     There is a large lack of support for Sped Students, teachers and support staff.     Moreover, ALL district employees are valuable and should be required to obtain subs and write out lesson plans, when they are absent. Otherwise, it can be very telling what jobs we think are worth covering and which are not. Sped students deserve more. Gen Ed teachers have the responsibly of all students, yet Gen Ed teachers are not adequately trained to support Sped students. ","PD from professionals. Intentional time to plan. If Title and Sped Teachers get ""time"" carved out to plan their groups, this should also be given to Gen Ed teachers. There is a HUGE disaparity about how much time elementary gen ed teachers have face time with their students vs. high school (way less minutes of student contact) vs. IEP/Title teachers who can cancel groups if they are sick, going to trainings, have to fill-in for another staff member, etc.     Please make this equitable for ALL  staff. ",Top down leadership. Lack of support in areas teachers need. Too much extra work on plates that are not part of our lessons.     Lack of support in class for Sped Students.     Gen Ed teachers are not trained to support Sped students. We are given an IEP plan with little to no understanding of these goals.   Lack of support from Sped Teachers.     The whole process to get a child evaluated is a ridiculous set of hoops to jump through and after that months upon months of waiting to get these meetings held. Takes nearly 1 year+ to get students on IEPs & to get the support in line for these students.  ,"More support from Sped teachers to gen ed teachers. Less the work for gen ed teachers to gather evidence, report students progress, etc. MORE support by hiring MORE individuals who are experienced. LESS waiting time to get students on IEPs/to go through the process.     Less work for gen ed teachers to get students through the process.     MORE communication from IEP managers to gen ed teachers and families.     LESS Sped only directed process and more involvement with gen ed teachers.

Yes,Yes,General education teacher,,Elementary school (grades Pre-K to 6),,,"More than professional development I would like to have the decision makers at the district level see first hand the impact these students (particularly behavior students) have on the classroom and school environment.    As of now, a student must be identified through the IEP evaluation process before we can access behavioral help at the district level.  ","Parents are given little information about Special Education in general and specifically the Evaluation process.  It's a very unfriendly system, even to those of us in the system.  I recently had a parent deny the IEP due to fearing we would take her child away from her if she agreed to his disability.  It's very difficult for parents who are second language/culture because they have preconceived ideas of Special Ed.  There needs to be a liaison to help with this.  As a teacher, I've tried to explain the referral process but there is nothing I can give them to help them understand once they are finished with my conversation.  The evaluation process takes so long and has so many pieces that it's difficult for parents to know what's happening.    The placement decisions are made by the availability of programs NOT on the needs of the student.  For example, I have a student who would be best served in DK but I'm told they are full or at trigger and that is not an option at this time.  It's the availability of resources that dictate student placement.    Placement decision ARE NOT made consistently across IEP teams or schools or even within schools.  If the counselor doesn't agree to do an assessment for IEP, it doesn't get done.  We have a counselor who is fearful of labeling students so she will rarely move forward with an evaluation causing delays in services.    Regarding data used to make decisions about placement, data is rarely collected as the Special Ed. staff in our building are often unable to even provide the minutes required  by students' IEP's.  They are often tied up with escalated students causing missed minutes for other students.  This makes it impossible to collect valid data on IEP goals.","Our staff is incredibly sensitive to the needs of special ed. students.  Our school has 2 Intensive support behavior programs for Emotionally challenged students.  As a result, the community has been with these students for many years.  ","1) Our Administration and District have a philosophy of allowing escalated students to wander the halls in agitated states.  This makes the learning environment feel unsafe.  Staff and students have been assaulted by escalated students.  What type of learning environment allows profanities, property destruction, racial slurs and threats daily?  Our district/administration has a hands-off approach which allows these students free reign to disrupt the  learning environment.  We have to check to see if the halls are safe to travel and have to alter our route.  These are not just the students in our ISES programs!  Just last week a 6th grade student exited the bathroom during another student's escalation in the hallway.  She stopped in fear not knowing which way she should go.      2)It has become accepted for staff to be assaulted by students with no consequences and staff are told, ""it's just the way it is"".  Really?    3) The allocation of Special Ed. staff hours leads to non-compliance of IEP minutes.    Our district counts IEP's to allocate.  Some IEP's require minimal hours and others require many Sped. Hours.  It is absurd to count them the same!  This leads to understaffing. We DO NOT have enough Special Ed. resources to adequately meet the required minutes to be in compliance.  Many of our Sped Teachers end up working to deescalate one student for hours missing their other IEP students' minutes.  When I've approached administration, I'm told there's nothing we can do.  I would go above building admin. for the sake of my students' learning needs but the District has made it clear that they do not want to hear from their ""peasants"".  At least that's what it feels like.    4) Our building has 2 self-contained behavior classrooms.  Last year one of those classrooms took an enormous amount of building support.  This caused the rest of the building to go without behavior or administration supporting it.  Having 2 programs in one building makes it inequitable across buildings.  Either these programs should be spread out across the districts' schools, or we should have more administrative support to account for the high-needs of these students.    5) Escalated students running the building for hours either as an administrative approach or district directed approach leads to other students modeling the same behaviors.  I've seen students with regulation issues start to act more like the students who elope and scream to avoid undesired activities.  This is not what we should be teaching our students!  In addition, the ""don't touch"" or redirect model used and encouraged leads to these students having emotional breakdowns in front of many students.  For example, a gen-ed. student of mine being evaluated for an IEP  has been screaming and crying in the middle of our 4 kindergarten classrooms at dismissal time.   Not only is this highly disruptive for the other students, it seems inappropriate to allow these students to be dysregulated in public viewing.  There's no privacy for these students and their disabilities are on display.  Where's the privacy for these students?    6)As a kindergarten teacher, I am rarely supported in my concern for students needing evaluations for IEPs.  There is a resistance in the building and Sp. Ed. department to evaluate students at a young age.  I understand that we don't want to label students who are just needing time to mature, but after almost 20 years of teaching, it's obvious to me when a student is far outside the norm for kindergarten.  My opinion is not valued and the solution often is to retain these students.  This is very appropriate for some students but for those who clearly need support to be successful, it wastes a year or more of their foundational learning.  If a student is evaluated and doesn't qualify, so be it!  What's the harm in having a screening tool or something to see if in fact further evaluation of disability is needed?  Are the tests valid or not?  It seems very inefficient, not student-centered and lacking urgency for early developmental skills.  It's easier to get students caught up before the gaps get so big!    7)  When our SpEd. students in our behavior programs integrate at recess, they often do not have proper supervision from their classroom support.  This leads to conflict with other students and physically fighting.  We also have no consequences for fighting at recess for any student and so it continues to occur as these students (Sp.Ed) and Gen. Ed return to the next recess to continue their aggression.  This is not a good model for students who have regulation issues and surely isn't what we want our students to learn.",,,

Parents were always very happy to receive information and really enjoyed the meetings. ",The IEP process is very laborious and time consuming and perhaps need to be changed on the state level to free up teachers/staff to have more time to simply teach students.

Then, they say they don't know the kid and can't give more support. Sometimes they offer a 1:1 knowing full well there are no available (TRAINED) paras. I have had students this year and last year that took months and months to get the district to listen to our school about. Principals have been injured. Staff has been injured and no central office folks come and even put eyes on our children. The standard response is that ""we haven't implemented the IEP"". So, we implement. I have to be honest - I don't have the specialized training I need to be a great SPED teacher these days. I can teach reading, writing, and math. I struggle to teach behavior (but that is my job now... no longer the psych). I struggle to teach emotional regulation and adaptive behavior but I am asked to do that. Then, when I know a student needs to be moved, I ask. I ask for one student per year... maybe... and it's always the same. It has been this way since Tim G left.

There is very little to no communication to teachers about the process for making sped placements.  2. The needs of the student are almost completely disregarded in respect to appropriate supports and school placement for IS students. Students used to be placed in a IS classroom where supports needed where the same or similar which was more helpful for student learning and teacher demands. Now students are placed in one classroom despite a huge range of abilities and needs. There are far too many students in a single class and too few paraeducators. Students are transferred several times mid-year based on the parents requests, even if there are already too many students where they are transferring to. Students are not able to reach their full potential due to these decisions. IS teachers and other teachers who work with these students do not have time to appropriately differentiate and address the needs of each student. Behaviors often derail a class and make it impossible to learn. Students are inconsistently attending gen ed classes and specialists, often without para support, which does not help the student learn consistently. Students are not safe due to student behaviors and significant measures must be taken to deescalate extreme behaviors.   3. Student numbers in IS classrooms and sufficient supports are inconsistent. Some schools have more para support or fewer numbers which creates a wide range of opportunity depending on location.  4. Due to the large range of needs and insufficient allocation of paras in IS classrooms, students who would otherwise have more support do not because of those students who consume most or all of the adult support.

An example would be a student who has special education goals in Math.  There is a belief that they should always be in Special Ed. Math.  It doesn't make a difference if a student has the desire to attend post high school higher education or not but it is the belief that they must be in a Special Ed. class.  That is not the LRE and special ed. classes in most cases do not meet the CADR board admissions requirements.  By not allowing access to Gen. Ed. classes we are eliminating students from the opportunity to go to a state 4 year university.  Some students are very capable of taking a Gen. Ed. class and being successful ,"I was told when I started here by Admin. that Special Ed. Teachers were not respected.  That for me is a huge problem.  We have a culture among some of the staff that see Special Ed. students as ""those kids"" or even ""your kids"".

Yes,Yes,Special education teacher,,Elementary school (grades Pre-K to 6),,,I have left Special Education and am now working full time as a Title I Teacher. Last year was far too demanding. ,"I have taught Special Education “Resource Room” for over 20 years. I left Special Education at the end of the 2021-22 school year for many reasons.     The district often pushes back on our recommendations for student placement. This has even happened when a student comes into the district with a special placement, but they place he student in general education and we have to push for the appropriate placement. The district doesn’t provide teachers based on the service areas and number of minutes a student needs in special education, but by caseload count. Some students require multiple services. Some just one. Last year my “caseload count” stayed the same, but my service areas increased by over 10. It’s physically impossible to do without reducing service minutes per day or per week.     I have not been able to give students the number of minutes they need because I have a limited amount of teaching time. For example, I  had a student that needed constant support in a general education setting, but a 1:1  isn’t provided and the classroom teacher is overwhelmed be the student’s needs. He and the other students in the class suffer for it. The situation continues this year.     Teachers often complain about what the process to help a student. Taking a student to the problem solving team  (PST for pre-sped interventions) is a slow process, then comes more PST meetings and data collecting. If classroom and Title I or behavioral interventions are unsuccessful, then it is on to the SPED Evaluation process and then possible qualification. New teachers often don’t know the process. Experienced teachers know it is a long haul.     As far as I know there is no set way to inform parents of this process unless they, themselves reach out to the school/district.     High poverty schools, especially one like mine with a high immigrant population, have to jump through even more hoops to get a student to qualify. Is the child’s struggle due to lack of English, low attendance, etc? In higher socioeconomic schools, parents are more likely to have a better understanding of the system. They also speak English fluently and can easily communicate their needs. We are EXTREMELY lucky to have a Family Advocate at our school. This has helped us tremendously. Without her, parent communication would be even worse. This person is vital to our process.     As far as “Staff members use data”…We, at our school use data. However, this is very often not the case at the district level for placing students. ","A well-defined and well communicated process for qualification.     A quickly scheduled Pre-Referral process and support implementing the interventions within the classroom.

Special education law, how to create a meaningful (and actually measurable) IEP goal, and how to teach specially designed instruction in emotional regulation, social skills, behavior, and learning strategies/organization are all needed areas of focus from my work with colleagues. ","I don't have the data to claim that placement decisions are made consistently across IEP teams and schools - it is not in my purview.     From my observations, placement decisions have less to do with data and more to do with ""how done"" a team is with a student. ",Most of our staff care deeply for students and put a premium on the relationship. ,"Our learning support department does not teach specially designed instruction in emotional regulation, behavior, social skills, and learning strategies/organization. Students are theoretically supposed to receive these services during their ""lab"" classes. However, not all students who have these services are in a lab. Moreover, even if students are in a lab the time is used to complete homework. Teachers will help students prioritize what to work on and help them with their work during that time. However, there is no systematic instruction for any of the skill areas that have been identified as SDI on IEPs. It is a gross misconduct of special education and one that has persisted in our building for many years due to ""culture"" and the push from teachers for students to do all the work that their gen ed peers do. We need more coaching and oversight to help our teachers begin to teach these skills. We need a stronger push for reduced work as a modification so that students are not failing as many classes and in turn, teachers feel that they can use the instructional time for what it is actually for - instruction.  These are the same students that are constantly getting in trouble at school, struggling with their mental health, and feeling overwhelmed by everything.

Another student last year would scream for an entire lesson, and the class just had to ""try"" to work around it. This student's IEP was done twice in one year because a grandparent was not satisfied with the first one. I have been in the district for 25 years, and I have little hope right now that students who need a different learning environment are getting their needs met and that the needs of other students are being met with their presence. The teacher is somehow supposed to teach and make a careful data analysis of a student to qualify. This is incredibly difficult to do. I remember a time when a behavior specialist came into my first grade classroom years ago and shadowed a student for a week to see if they could handle the gen ed environment. They found success with this intense one on one method. Having an educational assistant run around the room or babysit a student who is causing disruptions to the learning of others is not good for anyone. There has been no professional development that really underscores placement.

I had 6th graders placed on High School role up lists. I had several students placed on multiple lists. In August of this year, 4 students in my school alone in the intensive support programs where STILL not on the right lists. Parents were pissed that they didn't get information about their children's placements til June as administration was SO SLOW in communicating information. Plus then it was left to teachers to deal with angry parents when it was the district admins who had failed. Inquiries from teachers went dismissed or simply not responded to. Communication from district repeatedly said ""no placement was made without teacher input."" This was a flat out lie to cover their butts. Many many placement decisions were made without teacher input.    Further, in the spring of 2011, the district made the decision to close one of the IS classrooms primarily for students with autism with lower cognitive skills and high behavior need. Without consulting teachers, this whole classroom of students was sent back to intensive classroom in/near their neighborhood school. These schools were not given any additional training or resources (staff). Most of those placements failed, and the students had to be moved again to another school.

Starting the 22/23 school year, the caseloads were still ""projections"" and not placements. ","Our school has a good community of diversity.

We NEVER receive emails from any district admin level about anything. We receive stuff from teaching and learning, assessment, technology. But SpEd? Never in the last couple of years. ","The ""weekly memo"" or ""biweekly newsletter"" from SpEd that honestly was a joke. There was very little information given in these.

I feel like as a district we moved away from considering students’ needs and abilities prior to making placements. All team members need to be in communication and a part of the placement process.  Some examples:  Last year a new program at Woodway was created for a very small number of students. This program was created late in the spring and students were moved for the few remaining months of the school year. There was no transparency and little communication around the program. Teachers and principals did not know who would move to the program. All of this created rumors and speculations. Teachers were concerned their student would be moved to this program without their input.      Schools with self contained programs are impacted the most by the placement process. There is no clarity of what the process is for placing students in programs other than it being their neighborhood school. This created very difficult classrooms that require schoolwide support which puts strain on other parts of the school.

Example- the google forms were long and felt like a hoop to jump through when support was needed immediately. No response after completing google form.   Communication has been confusing especially around special education compliance changes and recovery services. ","Communication needs to be improved in Student Services especially be district leaders. During the 20-21 and 21-22 school years special education administrator (managers/director) staff grew significantly and with this increase communication and responsiveness decreased. During this increase in admin staffing the TOSA staff decreased significantly. TOSAs have always been the main support and line of communication without them teachers did not feel supported.   I have concerns about hiring practices for district administrators. I strongly believe district level administrators need to have admin certificates, especially when there are qualified staff with administrative certificates in the district.

There seems to be a new and additional form required for everything related to special ed. While there has to be some ""checks and balances"", making principals and teachers jump through extra hoops when they are in crisis with a student is not effective. The newsletter that was started for sped was not relevant or helpful to teachers in a pandemic. Guidance around IEP recovery services was confusing and unclear and changed often. District level communication needs to be responsive because typically there is no response or a very delayed response. ","Communication in Edmonds School District is fine. The issue has been within the district level special education department, primarily because the norm was no response. The Special Ed district admin staff grew significantly during 20-21 and 21-22 and yet responses were still absent or very delayed and teachers felt unsupported. As additional admin were added, the TOSA and coaching support went away so teachers got less support than they ever had in previous years (during the hardest years in education). "

As a parent of a special education student, I have seen placement vary by building. ","We have paraeducators providing services to students with IEPs and are not skilled enough to do so. Our building has unsafe situations where staff do not have the appropriate para support for students with 1:1 support. Our building does not have LAP support for students after grade 3, even though the divide in ability increases. The process to evaluate for special education can be most of the school year while that student continues to struggle. We are managing behaviors that should be given additional support.

Paras who are not skilled at academic subjects even at the elementary level (upper elem).    Learning support for most subjects is 90 minutes a week vs daily. In order to do daily, we would need more staff. Daily would be better for kids. We do what saves money instead, which is partly why I don't see them making great growth.    I am supposed to ""teach to the edges"" and not the average. I agree with this principle 100%. This means that all students can access learning at all times. I am working countless hours outside of my contract adapting lesson materials so all students can succeed because the district gives us the materials at average.","Hire Behavior Techs instead of paras for any students who have para support for behavioral goals.     Adapt lessons to be ready to meet the needs of various learners. Don't expect teachers to do this at the level we are. Here and there, of course. All day for all subjects and for so many levels, no.    Provide Lap Support for students K-12, but at the very least K-6. Pulling the support at grade 4 doesn't make sense and we have not seen the data support this model.     Provide more social emotional support for students by increasing counseling hours and not just for schools of certain sizes. We need more counselors to support students with special needs (IEPs) and behavior disabilities.     Actively seek and hire qualified paras. We cannot have paras supporting intermediate math skills who cannot do that math themselves. We have some paras who would not pass a 4th or 5th grade math assessment.

Yes,Yes,"Non-certificated support staff, including paraeducators",,Elementary school (grades Pre-K to 6),,,"Autism, cognitive disabilities, and learning disabilities","I think placements are based more on busing/home schools, so children may not be put in a classroom that is well equipped for their needs with staff who are familiar with children with similar needs. When this is done, the whole classroom can suffer and children pick up new dangerous or disruptive behaviors from other children. I also think decisions are made and meetings are had without special educators input about moving children from general education to IS. Lastly, I think it is always best put children in the least restrictive environment, that supports their needs and safety, and I think sometimes the comfort of the Gen-ed staff is prioritized so children are pushed into a more restrictive IS environments, without attempting to try additional supports in Gen-ed. ","There should be more education about disabilities to Gen-ed staff and students about disabilities, specifically related to children in IS(Intensive support) who are not in the Gen-ed classrooms as frequently. I think if Gen-ed teacher were given training related to special education teaching strategies and supports, and training on difficult behaviors so that children can be put in a less-restrictive environment that supports their needs.  I think more open communication between staff about transitions of children to gen-ed to IS. I think additional support and staff for IS classrooms so there are less injuries and staff does not get burnt out as quickly and discouraged as quickly. Physical supports and tools should be given more readily. I think safety care training should be mandatory for all staff. Better pay for IS paraeducators who often have to deal with bodily fluids, wear and tear on their body, under staffing, playing the role as the teacher when there is not one, and are required to do additional training. All of these things would help the culture to be more positive and collaborative as IS staff would feel supported, safe and respected. ","I think there is a large focus on learning support and IS is deemed as self-sufficient leaving us with less support. I think this causes a break in communication, collaboration and positivity between Gen-ed, learning support and IS. There are not a lot of subs for IS classrooms (both teacher and Paras) so if someone needs a day off they often leave the team short staffed. Yesterday my team was without a teacher so us paras had not choice but to fill the role of teacher. I have seen paras take the day off due to wear on their body from the classroom (often due to being understaffed or not having proper supports) then leaving the team even more under-supported/under-staffed leaving more room for injury.  I think a lot of IS paras are very discouraged and defiantly feel underpaid for all the important work we do. being underappreciated or underpaid contributes to burnout and under-staffing. It feels like a viscous cycle. As a substitute in IS classrooms last year, and full time staff this year, I have seen all of this in more than just my current school.

Then Mrs. Etnier was hired in July 2020, and after one year of her being SpEd director, from June 2021 to June 2022, we had an exodus of long-term employees in Student Services, many of them admins. They left not willingly, some even taking step down in their carrier, as they could not deal with the total lack of integrity in the new leadership, inappropriate behavior, nepotism, lack of focus on students and toxicity.   I addressed before all the reasons why our district has changed to worse.   Mrs. Etnier and Mrs. Geaslen are the reason for the lack of communication, false communication, and discord in the district, especially Special Programs.

I would like to STOP getting professional development in:  reading  writing  math  ,"The process for making special education placement decisions is unclear and not communicated to general education teachers, sped teachers, principals/admin, and/or parents. There is no consistent measure used to move children and we are often told ""we have this program or that program... this child doesn't 'fit' in either so they need to stay here with a 1:1"". Or they say they will send a specialist (ex. behavior) and that person will say the child is fine.  We are not given training on the process. I have spoken to several gen ed, special education teachers, and principals who have no idea which children can be moved to smaller/different settings. Placement decisions are rarely based on the needs of the student. I was specifically told twice this year a student could not be moved to a different placement because they didn't have ""behavior"" as a qualifying area on their IEP. Those students are not accessing their classrooms. Those students are being ignored by the system and their teachers because the teachers lack the training to work with these special needs students.  Placement decisions are inconsistent because some schools (particular teachers) are favored and trusted. If would had some sort of checklist that asked for specific data, had actual conversations BEFORE an IEP meeting, or were treated as professionals, it would be great. Clearly, the district admin staff ignores requests for meetings and conversations before meetings and will then tell the parent a child is a tricky puzzle to solve without ever seeing them once. Those who work with the children should make the decisions about them rather than people who have literally never set eyes on the child.  My biggest issue is the lack of understanding from district admin that our classes are over full and the support staff is under funded. I currently have a cap of 23 students but have 34 students on my roster. I have had no increase of support despite a child needing 1:1 support. (I guess that was a bit off topic.)   Decisions are made by district admin that do not know our kids. They do not know what my school, classroom, or resources are like and do not support teachers until the IEP meeting - at which point they often say we need to attempt an intervention cycle which will take another 6 - 9 weeks. In school time, that's too long for a child not to be getting what they need.","These factors would be facilitators:    Shared vision  Investing in the people to build a strong community  Positive leadership  Celebrating the ""wins""  Meaningful professional development  A culture that respects teachers and treats them like professionals rather than ""soft professionals"" and getting rid of teachers that are no longer doing their job  Community engagement  Allowing teachers to lead in more environments",Difficult cultural barriers and the lack of consideration  Admin at the district level (or school level) who forge their own path without staff buy in  Inequities that could be easily addressed  Students who are in the incorrect setting  Poor behavior management by teachers  Poor professional development  Treating teachers like they are a number rather than individuals  Poor district leadership (especially in SPED and ML/Diversity),"In my school there is a lot of transparency with the staff and the admin, but there could be more.    There is very little I find effective about the communication from the district admin to me. ","Newsletters that are supposed to be bi-monthly that only come out every so often.   Constant changes for support staff - I never know who to call  District Admin that are not available and do not respond to emails or calls and frequently cancel meetings for other ""emergent"" meetings  Not knowing who to call on the flow chart","SPED could have a newsletter or communication that is more frequent and had a plan/agenda for sharing. We get random emails and information and people do not know what is what.  We also have no required job a likes in elementary resource this year because there was no time that worked.  So perhaps training is offered, but it can not be counted as professional development because not all staff is there and it is not required.  I rely on my peers to help me know things because we all miss things.   The district admin says we all had training on the proper way to write accommodations. We did not have a training this year to my knowledge and I am still expected to know I can not use ""as needed"" as a time. Now, I know that because I'm a decent teacher. I can't be expected to know everything. The deadlines are NEVER told to us in advance. Last year we needed to work on ""recovery services"" and I spent hours doing documentation. Now, I have to re-do all the work because Haley and Dana didn't know what they were doing. It's embarrassing to work in a district with them as leadership. I can not access them when I have questions.  ACCESS would help solve the problem. It may also help for them to create a hard copy binder for each school that is updated each year."
Yes,Yes,"Non-certificated support staff, including paraeducators",,Elementary school (grades Pre-K to 6),,,"ASD and ADHD should be addressed in better detail. They are not addressed in depth nor frequently acknowledged. Often the ""professional development"" for the students afflicted with ASD in any form takes the form of behavior management and I think that is inappropriate. Why have I been taught how to sheild myself from an attacking aggressive student but I have not been given even the most basic of information on why a student may behave in this manner. While I  personally have background knowledge and an abundance of life experience in working with both children and adults afflicted by ASD and ADHD, I am genuinely surprised at the lack of context given to public staff about the disorders  themselves. While this may seem unnecessary I  am not asking for an excessively detailed health class, I am asking because other staff frequently ask ME questions about WHY their student behaves in certain manners. I understand ASD disorders have only recently gained traction in the medical study field and not a lot of information is accumulated, but what has been studied and learned is enough of a start to build some semblance of a training course for PD.   I want to add this is specifically directed towards the ESD schools that are not specialized for ASD students as I do not work at an ISP building and do not know their trainings or if they have exceptionally different PD (of course a large portion of differences will and should be had between the different programs). Due to increasing numbers of students diagnosed with ASD disorders, and parents having the main power to place their students where they feel is best, staff are struggling to make their classrooms feel like welcome cohesive spaces when one or two students out of 15-30 are displaying behaviors that make others uncomfortable despite the behaviors being harmless/non-aggressive. When this happens, staff are then spotlighted to answer their students questions about ASD behaviors, which *could be* a wonderful short learning experience for a class and instead ends up putting spotlights on adults who have no real answers to give students beyond ""don't be rude that just how _____ is"". This is unfair to staff, who then feel they have been put in a position they were unprepared for or possibly even embarrassed  due to sudden realization that they are clueless as an educator in this istuation and now have failed their students. This is unfair to the students not afflicted with ASD/ ADHD disorders who then feel the teachers/ school staff have failed them as educators who, in this moment, cannot educate; layered with the possibility of students not afflicted feeling reprimanded by a teacher who essentially tells them ""it is what it is, don't behave differently despite _____ behaving differently"" which is a non-answer that can lead to bullying. Addressing these situations much earlier on, starting in pre-k/kinder can lead to a much better overall outlook for ASD/ADHD afflicted adults if these things are taught early on and expanded upon over time as well as giving non-ASD/ADHD afflicted adults much better people skills for the future.   Lastly this is clearly unfair to students afflicted by these types of disorders as they have no control over where their parents choose to place them in the education system or how their symptoms present themselves. Above everything else, in regards to teaching about these disorders, the goal should be to protect these students dignity during their education experience and I see a severe lack of this focus, at least in non-specialized schools. While I understand it might be because the schools are not specialized, the problem lies in the fact that these students can still enroll in non-specialized schools but the district is continuing their staff training as if this is not happening in increasingly frequent amounts.   I realize this was a lot; thank you for taking the time to consider the thoughts and feelings of both your students and your staff members alike.","In our experience many teachers must debate parents on proper placement for students with disabilities. Parents frequently seem unwilling to acknowledge incorrect placement in the education system of their student based on their own preferences- whether that be location of a school or just plain embarrassment/shame or a genuine fear that an ISP school is nothing but a caged daycare for their child. I am alarmed at how frequently parents of students with forms of learning or development D.A. express their concern that IS programs are severely lacking and will not teach their children necessary skills but will end up being free babysitting where their childs needs will be ignored, and the staff ill prepared.  While part of this is due to previous lack of scientific and medical information on learning and behavioral D.A., many parents feel the school districts have not kept up to date with newfound information and teaching goals for students afflicted. This alone can keep parents arguing with educators about their childs placement, claiming educators are doing poorly at their job, the student just needs more accommodations when in reality their child is spending hours a day in an environment that can be extremely stressful to them and also not learning skills that they as an individual need for their future. This is a lose-lose situation for the student and they have no control over this as well as a teacher who is not equipped for this. It is unfair of a parent to ask an educator to essentially build an entire separate program for one individual student who is afflicted with a learning or behavior disorder when their student has been given access to the established program, with multiple accommodations, and remains unable to participate. To an educator who wants their students to thrive, this is isolation in one of the most heartbreaking forms for a student. The educator can do nothing besides try once again to change an IEP to fit a student into a class that they do not belong in. This is not a negative against a student and should never be considered as such; every child deserves to be in a class that they can both learn and socialize in, if a student cannot do one, the other, or in the most devastating circumstances cannot do either, it is inappropriate that a parent should be allowed the maintain their childs status there.   Sometimes learning looks like algebra and essays, sometimes learning looks like successfully putting on shoes without help or having a conversation with several sentences from an appropriate distance without cues. Both are valid and many adults struggle with this concept, but it is, again, unfair to the child to leave them in a situation where they cannot learn what they require to successfully thrive as an *individual adult*.   (Noted there are obviously certain cases where a student may always need an aide; this is again a valid situation that occurs often but the goal in most any D.A. teaching is independence at the highest level the individual student can achieve.)  I know this was a lot. Thank you for your time and consideration directed towards both your students, and your staff.",Compassion in abundant amounts from all staff members of every level.,"Lack of information given to the students of the educators as the educators themselves may care and have compassion for any and all students but have been given no real opportunity to include learning  or social activities with students with D.A. with the explicit purpose of creating a genuine empathetic  understanding in students not afflicted with D.A.. This means students with more visible behavior differences are frequently looked at funny or spoken about in negative manners such as ""stupid"", ""funny looking"", or condescending comments of ""why does ____ do this?"".   There needs to be more preventative educating to help alleviate these situations before they are created.",I enjoy the emails but I don't know what else would be considered communication practice here. I guess staff meetings but they are not as frequent.,Sometimes staff meetings are inefficient because the topic loses people's attention when they lose interest if they feel certain things are obvious.,Ensure a better understanding of responsibilities held by all levels so each level has a better grasp of what their individual goals should be as an employee and how they can better support the needs of other staff members responsibilities. This includes administration. If a person does not understand the responsibilities of another staff member it is much easier to not only disregard them as a staff member but also to feel as if they are over stepping their bounds.   Overall understanding of what responsibilities are assigned to who is one of the easier faster ways to have more cohesive staff effort.

So how do IEP teams even prepare to have such team conversations with the parents if we aren't given information on how placement decisions should be made and what happens if there are questions or team disagreement? How does that help students and families?? I don't think parents are provided with any information at all about placement options and how those decisions are made. My principal knows nothing about how placement decision-making SHOULD work nor how it actually DOES work in our district. General education teachers also do not have consistent understanding about placement and eligibility for services at different levels.

I think it very much depends on the individuals on the team- their level of experience, understanding of disability, belief in a student's capacity to progress, perception of LRE, comparison of students' level of functioning to other students at the same school, etc. Intensive Support placement decisions are NOT made with the needs of the student in mind. These programs are no longer meeting the needs of the most impacted students like it seemed they once were.","More inclusion time (in general education) for students in the Intensive Support programs; my principal understanding anything about special education and the students we serve and having a sincere belief that they have the same value and importance as general education students, and that their IEP status DOES NOT DEFINE them; additional staff to serve special education students would be a huge positive impact because we would have more time and options for serving students along the spectrum of need that exists in special education. Special education leadership should also be connected to each school and its needs. They should also be invested in providing high quality services to ALL students with disabilities, which would be demonstrated in adequate support at all service levels in all schools.",My principal remains ignorant of special education and that is a barrier for the culture of the entire school.

Why are there not more IS and EBD classrooms? Where’d they go? Also, another barrier that inhibits positive climate is Special ED not serving students until mid/late October. A check in from an para isn’t the same thing as having actual minutes  met.

I don’t understand this process. 2 weeks should be the maximum to get schedules worked out and start serving students .

Counselors do their job of protecting kids -- but it means students with higher needs get concentrated into a few ""good"" teacher's classes.  The classes become almost special-ed because of the number of students with needs (and often behaviors), and the non-iep students are underchallenged. It makes it impossible to see the challenge building-wide, and leads to teacher burnout.  A number of teachers, whether knowingly or not, put themselves in a position where they don't get special ed students (or very few) because the students consistently do not find success in the class.  To head off parent complaints and disproportionate discipline, students are not placed in that class as often as possible, or are moved from these classes.  We need more teacher accountability as far as serving *all* our students.  Teachers do not have enough support for this-- there's not enough time to modify instruction or knowledge/creativity as to how to modify or write instruction, and no pre-made resources to use.

It took 6+ weeks for the 1:1 to be hired. In the meantime, the student support team (principal, SiNC, FRA and two school psychs) provided 1:1 support for the student until the paraeducator was hired.  Meanwhile, the student could have been learning and getting acclimated to a new classroom during those 4 weeks. ","Just like the Title I team has a ""Title I Reading Night"" it would be great if we had a ""SPED Information Night"" for families of students with IEPs (across all the levels of LRE) so they could better understand the process and connect with other parents of students with special needs. Intrepretation and translation of documents would be essential.","My school serves a highly mobile population, so families move in and out of our service area. It's difficult to establish a long-term relationship with families when we gain and lose about 30% of our population per year. Many parents work more than one job, speak limited English, have limited education or an understanding of the American school system.","The district sends out a weekly communication to all staff and families. My school administrator sends out a weekly bulletin to staff and a separate one to families. This year we started using Parent Square, so we get notifications for time-sensitive information right away. ","This year my school was informed in October that we would have a Dual Language program starting in September 2023.  This was proposed to the school board in June 2022 but our staff wasn't informed until 4 months later, with less than a year to plan.  Many staff members are furious about this, worried about their jobs at our school and the displacement the program will cause.  Our school just moved into a brand new building after 7 years of planning, construction, moving and moving AGAIN.  The district should have informed our staff last spring before it was proposed to the school board.",Transparency!

Is there a difference?  Why do we sometimes call it ""Student Services"" and other times call it ""Special Education""?  Introduction of all SpEd administrators to the entire SpEd staff (district-wide).  Explanation of cross-over / overlap of communication between Managers of individual programs.  In other words, I feel the need for Professional Development about day-to-day operations of the district Special Education department.  There are times in my job where my Program Manager does not have the answers about IEPOL or the roles of other SpEd programs with whom we interface.  I believe it would be beneficial for Program Managers to attend each other's staff meetings so that - over the course of one school year - Managers would become more familiar-to / approachable-by staff and teachers who do not directly report to them.  This may also improve consistency between SpEd programs of information-sharing  (content and style).  In effect, this could potentially improve what I perceive to be the aim of ""job-alike"" meetings.","Having been involved in IEP teams in a variety of schools, programs and age groups, I have definitely observed discrepancies in process of placement decisions between Principals who ""rile with an iron fist"" or who ""carry a lot of weight"" in one IEP team's decisions versus other Principals or Vice Principals who are more willing to listen or who are not particularly involved in an IEP team's decisions.  Especially when it comes to transitioning from Pre-K SpEd to elementary SpEd / elementary SpEd to middle school SpEd / middle school SpEd to high school SpEd / high school SpEd to VOICE...IEP teams don't always know what the options are at the next level beyond their building's age-group.  Principals can sometimes be more focused on their reputation and how they run their specific building-operations than they are about the needs and disability-specific services of individual students.  Placement decisions are certainly influenced by those dynamics of various IEP teams - and their knowledge (or lack of knowledge) about a specific disability and what options exist in the district for an individual child.","(Answer is based upon the SpED PROGRAM I work with in that I do not work in only a single-school building.)  The sources of positivity for this SpEd program’s functioning are the specific-disability SpEd Teachers, specific-disability Specialists, and specific-disability Para-Educators who are caring, knowledgeable and invested in their work with each other and with this program’s students / families.  There is a decent amount of interdependency and open communication within the faculty and staff of this SpEd program which makes for positivity in our district-wide work, despite not having enough faculty and not having a team-atmosphere with our SpEd program Manager or SpEd Administration.","(Answer is based upon the SpED PROGRAM I work with in that I do not work in only a single-school building.)  Understaffing and unmanageable workload are the main barriers / inhibitors for this SpEd program’s improved effectiveness and forward-momentum.  There are not enough SpEd Teachers in this program who are trained / certified in the specific disability served.  The program Manager who oversees the program and the SpEd Administrators to whom that individual reports are all spread-too-thin / “wearing too many hats”.  This causes the program Manager and SpEd Administrators for this program to be unavailable and inaccessible for truly knowing the students, staff and culture / climate of the program in order to effectively manage the program.  Therefore, the teachers and specialists, feel unheard, unsupported, and uncertain of the program’s status / future – particularly in regard to leadership and whether or not there will ever be sufficient staffing.  Teachers and specialists in the program are largely self-directed, and this was especially so during the 2021-22 school year.",Human Resources does a good job of district-wide communication about new-hires and new-positions of which HR is aware / informed.  Dr. Miner is doing a good job of district-wide personal email messages which I believe are contributing positively to overall district-staff morale.,"     There was a structure / hierarchy of the SpEd (Student Services) department implemented several years back by the then-SpEd Director which I believe made sense and was well-communicated.  When that SpEd Director left the district, the SpEd department reporting-structure / hierarchy was maintained for the first year after the new SpEd Director was hired.  From there, the new SpEd Director was quietly promoted to a newly-created Assistant Superintendent position.  In my opinion, the occurrence-of and reason-for this change was not well-communicated from the district level or from the SpEd Administration level.         For a few years now, it has seemed unclear as to distribution of responsibilities between the Student-Services Assistant Superintendent and a variety of people who seem to have-been (and some who still are?) co-Directors of the SpEd (Student Services) department.  In 2021-22, the SpEd Directorship was quietly divided geographically between two people (one of whom took an out-of-state leave of absence for approximately half of the 2021-22 school year).  Also during 2021-22, it seems that responsibilities of the on-leave Student-Learning Assistant Superintendent were absorbed by the Student-Services Assistant Superintendent (who, one year earlier had been the single SpEd Director).  Now, for 2022-23, the SpEd Directorship seems to have been quietly divided elementary and secondary grades between two people (one of whose name is unfamiliar to me).  Regardless of how the SpEd leadership responsibilities are divided, it seems that too many responsibilities are placed upon too few people at many levels of the district.  This has created a feeling of being overworked, and has created a culture of lacking support and communication and cameraderie at most levels.         Over the past two years, the mashup of newly-created positions and SpEd leadership structure coincided with the arrival of a new district Superintendent, with the global pandemic, and with the one-year leave of absence of the Student Learning Assistant Superintendent.  In my opinion, that was too much poorly-planned change (in people and functions) in too short of a timeframe, with too little transparency / communication (regarding structure of district-leadership and SpEd department leadership) to a vast number of stakeholders.  I suspect that confusion, frustration and departure of front-line district SpEd providers during 2021-22 had a lot to do with changes at the top-tier of the district and at the top-tier of the SpEd / Student Services department which were not discussed or explained well to the district or to the SpEd department as a whole.","After hiring the next Superintendent this year, decide and communicate a district org-chart that can hopefully hold-steady for at least a couple of years while the new superintendent learns the culture / climate of Edmonds School District before knowledgably  approving / implementing organizational changes - especially at top-tiers."

I was the office coord for this department through all of 2022 and I was told to reach out to parents and send them a letter of notification of recovery services in June 2022. I had not even heard the words recovery services when I started my job and when I asked the director about what it was I was told it was a project we are working on. I was in charge of sending out every single letter to almost 500 students/parents to notify them of their offer of recovery services. When parents and teachers and principals emailed me I had no direct language or offer of support to speak on and I did not know how to answer any of their questions. I asked for help over and over and was denied training and help. I had to manually type each address of each family because no one would show me how to create address labels. I asked over and over for help with communicating the special education department decisions that they made on behalf of the student and I never was told what to say. It was a nightmare! I suggested they start as soon as possible after summer break to get recovery services rolling. Also I was assigned to create postcards for the high school students survey and I asked over and over what to say how to make post cards which budget it was coming out of. I got nothing. Now a year later it is being brought up again and acting as if I created something for the department. I have not been given any clear direction of what this will do for students or the school district.

I can't count how many times I have worked to make a teacher feel appreciated and heard when they expressed their concern for our department.   I have a school that still needs a hospital bed that the director signed off to rent for an entire year when a bed could have been purchased in place of for 1/10th of the cost. I have worked to receive a response and I am exhausted of trying to get an answer.

I am proud to work for special education department, because I do believe this department is hopeful in learning how to create a thriving department, but it has been a struggle from my first day here. I do enjoy working for the district and this department. I am hopeful we will turn it around and make it great! We just need some serious help with administrative management. ","There is a lack of clarity and communication of the needs of upper admin. If I am asked to do something and I asked follow up questions to help me better understand what they want and need, I am given vague answers and sometimes I think it's because they don't really know what to do themselves.  I think teachers feel devalued by their department when it is their chosen career path to help students and families with disabilities. It is difficult to hear their struggle for clarity and assurance. When a staff member is out, who do you call, can they get a para? Do they need to cancel class? Do they need to work without extra help, is someone going to show up as a district rep to the IEP meeting or will it have to be rescheduled and when. ","The special education district office administrative staff has a problem with gossiping and talking behind peoples backs. The management and Admin staff in my opinion from first hand communication and working directly with them do not support the classified office staff who are trying to get work done that they don't know how to do. We want to create a well working environment for all staff so that we can communicate clearly to parents and families of students with disabilities. It is embarrassing to not be able to answer a question of who and when is someone going to respond to a parent. ""I'm sorry Mrs. __ I have asked my manager 5 times and 5 other managers in my department to help me in assisting you for over a month.""  Listening and responding would be number one.

These parents are so uninvolved, despite many attempts to engage them, that the kids will most likely suffer through their whole public school education.","Special Ed teachers and paras having time to check in regularly with gen ed teachers, not on their lunch breaks or noncontracted time. Working together, and not killing the messenger, aka the gen ed teacher, when a problem arises.  Not telling the teacher that the para assigned to provide SDI cannot be expected to deal with a student's behavior because they haven't been trained for that. When the student is pulled out for SDI to work one-on-one, or in a small group, that student is that para's responsibility, and if that para can't handle it, someone who can needs to be assigned.  The student should not be sent back to the teacher without receiving SDI because the para says his time is more valuable than that.  Train the paras!  Let the gen ed teacher speak at the IEP meeting.  Do not keep the same accommodations that aren't working.  Do not make the teacher find two places for the student to time-out in the classroom when the two places do not exist due to lack of space. If a student is violent, do not make the teacher call up to 5 numbers of staff who won't answer.  There is no time for this when the student is choking another student!  And then we are told not to put hands on a student because we could be sued.  Leaving teachers to deal with this type of physical violence in a classroom doesn't give them a choice, and is putting them in a vulnerable position. ","Special ed teachers are treated like special ed students, like they're not really a part of the team, like they're not smart enough to be ""real"" teachers. They are treated like special ed students are their students, their problem to solve.  Sped teachers are expected to be the counselors, the mediators, the disciplinarians, the liaison to students, teachers, parents, etc. Sped students are gen ed students first, and they should receive the same services provided to other students by specialized staff.  Every time there's a new, and often impossible, expectation, the district has no problem assigning the work to special ed teachers. The lack of appreciation and respect, and the lack of insight into what sped teachers are already doing is appalling.  No one at the district office seems to know what the job entails. ",Most effective are communications that come directly from teachers. ,"Getting a message from the district that is then relayed by the principal. Forms are sent out at district and building levels, then teachers are made responsible for collecting them, figuring out who hasn't submitted them, then contacting parents to make sure they get them. ","Fewer staff meetings that are redundant or pointless. I have a parent who calls me 3 times a week.  She takes about 30 minutes to check in each time. This is frustrating, as it leaves me scrambling to get ready for my day.  At the same time, I'm glad she wants to be involved, because many of my parents refuse to meet or respond, knowing their kids need support. Most of the communication between admin and staff can be done in email, or shorter time periods. We need time to communicate with parents and our grade level teams.  We are now doing that during lunch twice a month. I like my team, but this is infuriating.   Stop forcing any communication that is irrelevant for the sake of checking a box. Teachers know what they need to do when they have time to collaborate.  Parents need to partner with teachers.  I have never seen such a cognitively low group of students as I have this year. Let us put our heads together and problem-solve. Stop all of these staff meetings.  When admin and district send communications that are redundant or not vital to each parent's child, parents stop reading them. "

Whenever bigger and persistent behaviors are involved, there is a consistent and obvious disconnect between schools and the district admins and managers. For example, we can collect and present 6-10 weeks of documented data around unsafe behaviors and still the sped department won't see it as an urgent need or that more support is required. That's if they respond to emails at all. Even if the data shows needs for a student to be in an ISES classroom, that doesn't mean a kid will be put where it's best. There is either no room available, or putting them in one of the available rooms around the district destroys the progress those students in that ISES classroom have made. Placement process for behavior students is not clear, especially when a child is so violent that an emergency placement is necessary to keep everyone safe. ","There are too many unsafe behaviors and kids with huge SEL needs and not enough staff to support the amount of escalations, which takes time and energy away from other students with disabilities.

Yes,Yes,"Related service provider, psychologist, or other certificated specialist",,Elementary school (grades Pre-K to 6),Middle school (grades 7-8),,how to support inclusion for students with significant disabilities,"Almost all placement decisions are made by SPED admin capriciously, without knowing the student or the receiving program. Supports are NOT provided for students with extreme needs - the receiving program is expected to create the support themselves, without adequate staffing or training. I see children ""dumped"" all over the district into different intensive support programs all of the time, without any discussion about their needs or the ability of the receiving program to meet those needs. Students in preschool are placed in classrooms based on which bus they will be on, rather than their individual needs.     When we see a bad placement decision being made by admin and communicate our concerns, we are either told that we just have to make it work, we are reprimanded for insubordination, or else admin simply don't respond for weeks (leaving us to figure it out without them). Principals are told to solve staffing and placement issues without any guidance or training.     We get zero support to make sure that students in intensive support programs are able to access appropriate inclusion. Zero staffing for inclusion, zero training, no ""seats"" in gen-ed (literally our children aren't given chairs in the room, placed on the class roster, etc) so most of them get no meaningful inclusion beyond sitting through morning meeting and saying ""hello"" to a peer. They don't get to be included in gen-ed unless they are able to do it almost independently... which violates federal law but we have no other option because we have no support.     We don’t even have curriculum for our intensive support classrooms! Our students don’t get access to gen-ed, and they don’t get special ed curriculum either. They get whatever their teachers are able to cobble together in between bathroom breaks.  ","The ISSD department certificated staff has a strong preexisting culture of shared decision making, collaboration, and generous support of each other. We are able to center our decisions on what is best for students because we know that our professional needs will be met. This preexisting culture is not shared by current SPED admin (starting when Dana Geaslen joined the district), and that culture clash has been painful and alarming. Our ISSD admin in the past were amazing, and they all left in 2022 because of the problems with SPED admin culture. Amongst certificated staff, we have a culture of transparency, shared decision making, respect, and authentic SUPPORT which has helped us to build our current staff.  ","Lack of shared decision making between staff and admin is a barrier to a positive climate and culture in special education. SPED admin treat staff (particularly teachers) with disrespect, and refuse to engage in meaningful power sharing. They make decisions without input from stakeholders. When those decisions fail, they refuse to share information about what is going on (so that we could help). They develop new programs in secret, give us a glitzy “reveal” of whatever new program they invented (which usually fails to meet the need, since they don’t ask us what we or students need), and then get mad when we point out problems with their plans. Many of them are new to our district, or new to administrator work, and they are not good at their jobs so they NEED to let us help them by providing information, but we are viewed negatively when we try to help, so we stop, so they fail… It’s a vicious cycle. Furthermore, when decisions NEED to be made, SPED managers and directors are not empowered to solve problems, and have to run every decision past Dana Geaslen. This creates a dynamic where problems cannot get solved because no one is empowered to authorize solutions, and we all have to keep pushing and pushing in order to force something to change. It is exhausting and demoralizing to have to fight admin for every single thing that we need.     Employment-based retaliation is a barrier to a positive climate and culture in special education. Admin engage in targeted retaliation against staff who call them out on bad decisions (often by changing assignments or work location of the targeted staff). This kind of retaliation has happened to me personally, as well as to several other staff who have spoken with me about what happened to them. It has a chilling effect on all of our work, and ability to function productively with administrators who are regularly incompetent, and unable to learn how to do better.     Admin incompetence and lack of concern around adequate staffing are a barrier to a positive climate and culture in special education. Admin refuse to listen when we have concerns about understaffing (they give the same excuse every time - “there is a national shortage”), and nothing changes. Even when we are clearly violating a student’s IEP by not providing their least restrictive environment, or not providing 1:1 support when it is mandated, admin do nothing. I have seen students restrained in their wheelchairs without the 1:1 staff necessary to keep them safe (watching for seizures, etc), because staff had to help another student calm down from an autistic meltdown and we didn’t have enough people to do both. When we bring this up to admin, they cite the national shortage and end the conversation. No solutions are ever offered.     Lack of concern for meeting individual student needs is a barrier to a positive climate and culture in special education. When we bring up student needs that we do not have the resources to support, again regularly fail to respond with anything other than blaming us for not knowing what to do. They tell principals to solve the problem, without giving principals any resources or special ed training either. They put off and put off and put off until eventually we tire of constantly bothering them with (at best) no response. If we escalate an issue up the chain of command, we are reprimanded and risk further retaliation and risk to our jobs.      Lack of support for teachers with difficult assignments is a barrier to a positive climate and culture in special education. We have had massive numbers of teachers quitting or going on leave mid-year, when they were given impossible classrooms with hardly any support. We STILL have an unstaffed intensive support classroom in one of our high schools, which has been unstaffed all year (violating federal law!). We are not providing special education services to those students, and there is no plan to fix that. Historically, we have *never* had staff morale this low, or this many career teachers quitting in the middle of the year because they are having a mental breakdown.      Lack of physical safety for staff is a barrier to a positive climate and culture in special education. We have job sites that have extremely high turnover because we have so many L&I injuries. These happen when we do not have adequate staffing in our intensive support programs, and staff have to do too many wheelchair transfers or other physical work to keep students safe. In my building, I know of 3 staff members who have had to leave education permanently because of job-related injuries. Two others are currently out on health leave, and may not be able to return. Admin do not even appear to be concerned about this issue.     Lack of ability to communicate clearly and effectively is a barrier to a positive climate and culture in special education. Admin rely on a poorly-formatted, incomplete and inaccurate “SPED newsletter” to roll out new policies and share critical information. It is regularly wrong, difficult to navigate or process, and effectively prevents people from asking questions and advocating for what they or their students need. Admin rely on the newsletter instead of providing actual TRAINING on new (or current) policies. ","Job-alike meetings, leadership team meetings (with certificated staff and admin), emails summarizing information that has previously been shared in person, our SLA department website (used as a reference and place to review/refresh our memory about policies and procedures). ","The SPED newsletter/memo. It is badly written, often inaccurate, difficult to read, has incomplete information, and does not answer our specific questions. It is a waste of their time to create, and a waste of our time to try and read it.","Stop spending time on the SPED newsletter. Schedule regular job-alike meetings (possibly during the early release Fridays, or during the 2nd staff meeting of each month), and do training during that time. Answer questions from staff in a timely manner. If an issue is taking longer than expected to receive an answer, provide regular updates about the status of the question or issue until it is resolved.     When staff ask for resources, stop using the excuse of the national educator shortage to cover for bad leadership or management. A labor shortage does not change our legal obligation to students. Special ed admin need to stop abdicating their responsibility over to HR to fill empty positions, and start taking initiative to keep working on staffing needs until they are filled. "

Yes,Yes,General education teacher,,,Middle school (grades 7-8),,How to balance meeting the needs of ALL students not just the ones with IEPs.,Students are often placed at Alderwood Middle in the Life Skills that are not appropriate for that program. Students with behaviors derail the life skills class and take the time of administration away from their duties to manage behavior issues. IEP case managers have to fight with district personnel to get students in the proper placements. We are not trusted to use our own knowledge of the students and their needs to make placement decisions. (I used to be a Special Educator but moved out to General Education due to these reasons).,"The Special Education teachers work together to make sure that GenEd teachers know the needs of students. This helps us to make sure that students' needs are being met and accommodate students in the way they need. Students with IEPs are included in General Education classes to the extent possible, including students in the life skills class (PE and possibly elective).","A life skills class was brought to our building without the building being designed for one. They do not have a private toilet, a kitchen, or many of the other facilities of life skills classrooms in other buildings.

Teachers do not always know who to contact (partially because so many ESC employees left in the last two years). There was a 'weekly memo' that was difficult to find and was sometimes late or changed after Monday. Changes in staffing at the ESC was not clearly communicated to teachers.","ESC employees should all need to respond to emails within 2 days (just like teachers do).

As such, even if the students with IEPs need morning sessions, parents need to dismiss because the district is not able to provide what the families and students need.  Session time is also late, because of the TRANSPORTATION NEEDS.

We have had our Sped classes cut halfway through the year, students cannot change their schedule if there's a conflict with another classmate, and we constantly need more para support but are not receiving what we ask for.  Our Sped teachers are doing what they can to help students and abide by the law, but the district doesn't seem to support the teachers, the schools, and often will often just cut corners cost-wise but blame the individual schools and teachers for not doing enough.","A third-party consult.

The lack of communication and training has made classroom behaviors infinitely worse.      It is important to acknowledge that Sped is overwhelmed because there was essentially 2 years of students unable to enter and/or receive proper special services.  We need to have more attention to special education because each year, more students are falling through the cracks and we are only funded so much because we are slowly identifying those that would have been entered in during those two years while also helping catch up those that lost full services for so long.  We are working in the post-pandemic world with pre-pandemic funding.  It is impossible to work as we are now, the district needs to acknowledge and address this.","Calibrate special services, take staff members' knowledge into consideration when providing PD, find funding/acknowledge this deficit as to actually support "

The one person that was instructed to ""train"" us had a poor relationship with leadership and soon refused to answer training questions. My direct supervisor rarely even spoke to us. The environment started changing in the Spring of 2022 and that is when leadership was more available to ask questions/clarification and I finally developed a deeper understanding of my job and what I was doing and was able to grow in my position. ",My job does not relate to student placement,"Leadership in Student Services is trying harder this year to facilitate a positive office environment. They are more available this year, trying harder to create more team building efforts, more meetings to communicate, this year leadership actually get along (ISSD and Teaching Programs) and are leading cohesively. I applaud their efforts this year as they faced a difficult environment with teachers this school year.","There were MANY barriers that inhibit a positive climate within the Student Services dept. The 21-22 school year leadership did not get along well (ISSD VA Teaching Programs), Leadership did not communicate well, did not train incoming employees but expected us to complete important work without making sure we understood what we were doing. Last year there were MANY personal conflicts with employees  that had been working here for many years which resulted in office fights, yelling, intimidation, office bullying, gossiping, spreading rumors and lies. Coming into this environment as a new employee was shocking. Public education seems to have their hands tied to let trouble employees go because these employees brought in the union to protect them. This type of behavior would not exist long in private companies. A few employees were incredibly unhappy and instead of finding work that would make them happier they insisted on causing chaos and trouble within the dept. Even when leadership was trying to make changes- these employees still resisted and were not happy. Our work is incredibly important to our most vulnerable students in the district and I am passionate about it. But the office environment here is completely unhealthy and toxic. One employee was hired with no basic office skills and that employee is struggling with her work load. She feels compelled to ask co-workers to help do her work, needs constant explanation, support and hand holding from leadership. She is also aggressive in communication with fellow coworkers ""to have her back and support her no matter what"". Also- one specific employee takes excessive ""leaves"" and leadership requests that the other OPs take parts of her work while she is out adding to our work load. However- when other OPs are out- leadership does not ask us to do their work. This feels like special treatment and really drives the overall morale lower. I honestly respect leadership this year because managers are getting along- having more meetings to communicate with OPs, are much more supportive and really trying their best to promote a positive environment. But the dept doesn't seem to be able to discipline, control or even handle the employees that ruin the environment for everyone else. Sometimes nice people are not just a fit for a position esp when they do not understand their role or responsibilities. Make it easier to kindly remove people who can not or will not do their jobs.

Classrooms having to lock doors, listen to screaming and obscenities outside the building and within the building and students having to vacate their classrooms for the behavior interventions are not meeting the needs of all students with any degree of equity. In addition, reprimands from administration for email communications of concern that didn't go through ""the chain of command"" were demeaning and devaluing.","Plans that support individual students AND the educators working with them. Many teachers do not feel ""heard"" when describing behaviors that are impacting an entire classroom. As teachers, we have a greater ability to tailor instruction and support students with academic needs. Trying to support students with academic needs in the midst of behavior disruptions is not very effective.","While our district claims to support equity, in our classrooms we do not see equity in access to education when the needs of a very few individuals appear to be prioritized far above the needs of all of the students in our classroom. All of our students need an environment conducive to learning and teachers that are able to assess and adjust education for advanced learners, learners at grade level and learners who need additional support.  ",Practices that take into consideration the needs of all - all students and all teachers. ,Expecting educators to come up with additional time during the day and outside of the school day for communication and training.,"I don't think educators have felt ""heard"" during the last few years. There is an atmosphere of discouragement and hopelessness that has accelerated during the last few years.  There are educators who are not referring students for support because there seems to be little help available, or the teacher's workload will increase with the ""suggestions"" others think should be implemented in the classroom. Often it seems that those coming up with plans for support are not very realistic or knowledgeable about what will actually work for a teacher in a classroom setting (and the other students who do have a right to an equitable education).

This new shift has created multi-age classrooms with a much more diverse needs and the district has not recognized this shift nor have they provided any professional development around how to support this wide range of needs.  I would like to see more professional development around specific needs such as communication (ie students who are non-verbal and use technology), how to support students who are cognitively at a preacademic level (ie 2-3 years)",I believe that a student may or may not qualify for services depending on what school they attend.  ,I believe transparency from the district sped leadership and consistent opportunities to communicate (ie monthly check ins) would be the first start to rebuild trust between sped teachers and the district.  Although Job Alikes are critical and valuable I would also like to see opportunities for IS teachers to participate together (versus at individual schools) for required district trainings.  These trainings rarely consider the needs of our students and I think time to collaborate as colleagues of students with similar needs would allow time to translate and modify instruction in a way that allows access for our unique students.,The district staff that has not yet quit have been doing the best that they can under the circumstance but their priority is dealing with crisis and they are simply spread to thin.  There is no one available to support classrooms or instruction on a consistent basis.,If we were to have the 2 week newsletter with an opportunity to respond or provide input I think it could be an effective practice.

There is especially a lot of push-back from above if a team determines that a student needs a level of support that is going to cost money (e.g., a 1:1 para, transportation, etc). It's really tiring, and definitely doesn't feel driven by student need. I also think that gen ed teachers aren't well informed about the process for evaluating and getting students on IEPs, and what steps need to take place first (tiered intervention within the gen ed classroom, data taken to show that those interventions aren't working for the student, etc).",More learning for non-special-education staff about special education processes and how we are all working together,"I do not believe our current district administration cares about special education because they consistently show that they do not trust the professional judgment of the educators doing the work with the students, and they treat us with very little respect and support.","At my school, the principal is INCREDIBLE at supporting communication in all directions. She has an open door and is committed to letting all staff share and discuss ideas at staff meetings. She sends consistent and very approachable weekly staff newsletters. She is open to new ideas and is respectful of the expertise and judgment of the special education staff at our school, but will also provide guidance and support when needed.","At the district level, to be frank, I find all of the communication ineffective. I cannot stand the online SPED newsletter they send out -- it doesn't seem to come out consistently, it requires too many clicks and going down through multiple layers to find the information relevant to me. I feel like leadership in my own department (ISSD) doesn't really care about staff meetings this year, and they have been almost pointless. I don't feel the information I really *need* about timelines or changes to procedures (IEPs, etc) is disseminated in a thoughtful and useful way.","Not sure how to fix the above, but I know it's not working great from the district administrators down.

To many close calls of serious harm and/or has been serious harm. Lets get smart about this. We are the educational institute. Safe, well designed place for students, staff, subs, custodians and pay them for the full 8 hrs other wise you will always have unsafe working conditions. People need to make a living to work here. Its simple math.","Your putting the cart before the horse. You need a place that is designed for special needs to keep them safe. You cant teach a kid who is bleeding from putting his hand through a window or running down main street with cars. You cant put someone (Sub) with a student who doesn't know that kids triggers. You have to have a safe place first and foremost. After that you will never have a consistent employees that know the students if you don't pay them 8 hrs. Simple math. People work where they can afford to live. Its about the kids, lets get serious about the game. Stop penny pinching the ones on the front line, the grunts and stop OVER paying the top glass house people and all of their assistances, on top of assistances. If its about the kids lets get real. These kids have been put into unsafe conditions along with their teachers/caretakers. If you don't have teachers/caretakers how can you take care of the kids. District needs to give the tools to do the job, safe environment & 8 hr pay to keep workers. Get the structure down first.  ","First and foremost, A safe building, windows, doors, sidewalks, lock down of rooms to keep an out of control student from running away or causing harm to others, running into the street with cars or just disappearing.   Second is you cant have invested staff when they are treated differently. The value of a special needs teacher should be at least the same as other teachers. Body injury risk is higher than the NORMAL teacher. They deal with Diapers, feces, bodily functions but don't get 8 hrs a day pay... Shameful..! Its simple math, value their hard work, loyalty, dedication. People cant live where they work.","Not a safe site. Its an old building, not designed for the special needs. Don't want to treat specials needs different but their needs are different. For example someone with sever allergies cant live in a home that triggers it. They need special criteria's. There is no big one lump sum for all. ","I believe that the schools are way more effective in communication and following through than the district. I can go on and on. I have so many examples. District has the worst communication and the trickle down effect is like every department just decides this is how we are going to do things.  Example, How did the name Woodway campus get changed? Brian Harding just decided one day? I as a custodian went to put in a work order and my school wasn't on the list of schools. I called maintenance and they had to get back to me because they need to find out the new name and enter it. At an LMC meeting i spoke up when my bosses said Former Woodway campus and I corrected it saying its been changed and my bosses including Mark Rouche looked at me like I was crazy and that had been a good 6 months sense the change. I feel that the district (ESC) has gotten to big and top heavy, to many assistance on top of assistance. Jobs have been created to cover up the assistance jobs and communication has been hit hard. We are an educational institute and district needs to get it right before we expect workers and students.  ",District broken... Schools do a great job.,"People need to be heard. People are afraid to speak up because they are on the lower end on the chain. They just need to keep their jobs. Someone has to give an outline, a structure, make hard decisions. People in higher positions are protected from their assistants because they don't want to be bothered. meaning you either get an answer that might be right or not, a passive I don't know, just do blank or your own call.   Question, If its really about the kids why is there so much money spent on fancy stuff for ESC kitchen, Etc. instead of proper parking lot ice melt for staff, staff are the ones taking care of the children. If you don't have staff you don't have someone to take care of the children. Ice melt money should be put away and be on the ground before snow and Ice like our DOT does. Seems simple to me.

There is NO priority given to SPED students when creating class lists for upcoming years.  If a student (SPED or just really tough kid) has a strong relationship with an upcoming teacher, then fostering that would help set that student up for success.

The schools office staff was amazing in how they supported me. Principal was great.   The district would send me staff when available but it happened rarely.     One thing I think would be great to remove barriers for the upcoming DK students would be to have the DK support staff from the previous year, help support the first graders at their new school.

It also seems like first grade is the year that student behavior/ learning disabilities are considered unless students qualified in preschool. It’s written off as age appropriate when the research shows early intervention makes a big difference for most disabilities.

The administration started a preschool program that was NOT the recommendation of the Preschool Inclusion Work Group.  They changed our developmental preschool so that ECEAP students could get busing.

Yes,Yes,"Related service provider, psychologist, or other certificated specialist",,Elementary school (grades Pre-K to 6),Middle school (grades 7-8),High school (grades 9-12),,"There are many instances in which placement decisions are made not based upon the program needs or the student but upon the neighborhood school of the student.  SPED students are thus in very mixed classrooms without support.  Additionally, there is very little administrative knowledge about particular students and not much consultation with IEP teams about where students should go when initially entering into or transferring into the district.  This problem is especially problematic when tranistioning from one school (Kinder to elem or middle to high school).  It seems the focus is on saving $$ on bus money rather than on placing the student in the least restrictive program to meet their needs.   At the preschool intake evaluation level, the evaluation team makes recommendations, but students are seemingly randomly placed based upon their geography and classroom ""openings"" rather than classrooms that would best meet student needs.  Lest this be written off as ""pandemic chaos"" this chaos was going on after the adminstration at the cabinet level changed hands prior to the pandemic.  Administrators used to know us as team members and solicit  our input in terms of placement. ","-Trusting and taking input from teams   -Knowing staff and programs well enough to make good placement decisions about students   -Budgeting for best practice rather than ""adequate only"" programming   -Staffing at adequate levels that allow for smaller classrooms to promote learning rather than just behavior management : teachers, OT's, paraeducators, nurses are understaffed   -SPED takes extra time.  More time (staff) needs to be given to it.   -Respecting union contracts     ","I work in  numerous schools: 1.) At preschool the district decided this year to launch a new program of inclusive education.  There are many problems with this model . I was on a team that made some recommendations about how to phase this program in and there was no phase in. We came back in the Fall and ""this is how it will be."" :  there was not a general education preschool option to begin with that blended special ed student into it as at other districts  (the reverse was true.)  Thus, we are ""recruiting"" gen ed students rather than first serving preschool to all students who live in our district .  Those classrooms are overfull and understaffed for safe and calm learning environments.  There is not a safe outdoor play space at Woodway Center (children wander off campus frequently) and the building admin there doesn't believe in ""fencing children in"".  The ECEAP students filling the classrooms have needs of their own even if they are not on IEP's because of their many ACES creating a chaotic environment. There are too many kids with high level needs in those classrooms and teachers are burning out fast. The inclusion does not replicate what inclusion looks like in Kindergarten. For example in Kindergarten, you might have 1-2 high need IEP students and 1-2 students with high level needs due to poverty or other life factors.  That would be 25% of a class make up, not 75% as is the current case at preschool.  2.) ISSD leadership changed ( all of our managers left the district) at the end of 2022 not because they were not competent and well-regarded, effective leaders from within the district who knew the district , but because they were not trusted by or listened to cabinet level administrators; this has left ISSD staff with very little direction given all new leadership.  they were also given far too much for any one person to do. Again this could be easily be attributed at cabinet level , challenging for all of us to be sure, to the pandemic, but the issues were beginning to emerge prior to the pandemic. 3.)  There is a focus on reducing cost of SPED ( discussed and witnessed in person by many staff members) ex. : placing students based upon address rather than the best progam to meet their needs, ex.  over-assigning tasks to managers beyond the capacity of one person to do. ex.  most students have asst. principals but preschool programs do not even though the level of SPED students is a higher percentage than anywhere else, etc.   We need to budget for what we need to provide the best education for all students and not reduce best services to kids to a 'just adequate"" level just because of budget.  There is a cost to providing for the needs of SPED students that is always higher than gen ed students.  4. )  Administrators in SPED need to be numerous enough to know staff, know programs, know what programs need to happen.  Example:  We have many students attending ""work experience"" at Scriber who are really not work experience candidates.  The kind of program those students formerly were placed in is not absent.  These students do not integrate at all with gen ed students on that campus and rarely in their job placement in the community.  Some partnerships could be happening at high schools.  5.) Upper level admin doesn't seem to know teaching or ISSD staff at all since Dana took over; they are too tasked with too many things . If you don't know your people, you don't know your true resources. 6.) Communication that is not embedded only in online documenation.  That process does not allow for any clarification.  Some way to get the clarification needed in person rather than always being redirected to read the documents online that are somewhat open to interpretation.  7.) No real way to evaluate SPED teachers that is meaningful:  there are a few teachers/cert staff who really require growth. The current evaluative process does not allow for any peer input.  And peers who might provide input don't trust upper level administrators to feel free to provide that input. 8.)  At the cabinet level and just below,  There is fear of retaliation if any unwanted input is given. that climate needs to be reversed. ","-School-wide bulletins to family/staff have been very helpful at keeping everyone informed   - regular in-person staff meetings are more effective than Zoom meetings because they foster relationships , though take more travel time  -TEam meetings to plan for specific students or policy changes   -Including ISSD staff more (under former ISSD leaders) in buildings has helped increase visibility and educate our teachers on the resources of the ISSD department; we are more a part of the entire school team  ","-while the SPED bulletin is a place to go for updated information, educators know that people learn and retain information in  multi-modal ways, so a lot of information gets lost and not found in that document. There is not place to go if you need clarification, etc.   - The pandemic has given us the chance to use tech for meetings. This is time-efficient but it is not relationship -efficient; it does not build knowledge of colleagues's professional or personal selves . This needs to a continuing focus   -Responsiveness to safety or legal issues must be timely and there needs to be a process in place for student and district safety; it has taken weeks to months to hear back in buildings or cabinet level, even after a phone call is placed.     -pLacing students based on where they live might save money on buses, but it does not always address the least restrictive requirement of the best classroom setting for each student   -SPED students transitioning from one school/program to another needs to be started earlier in the year and be more efficient   -Respect for staff knowledge and inclusing staff in decision-making needs to be practiced more regularly   -Bulletins and SPED announcement are full of acronyms that are often not defined.  This makes it hard to speak the language or understand the meaning, esp if you are new. ","-the current approach feels very ""top down"" . We have operated in the past with a much more collaborative model of ""how can we all improve this situation or solve that problem"" : collaborative leadership   --Responsiveness to staff concerns about student safety or legal issues must be timely and there needs to be a process in place for student and district safety   -Honor agreements:  example . An entire committee of us worked on a phase in multi-modal model for the new preschool program.  None of that was heeded and we are having a super-rough time of it meeting the needs of the students.  MOre parent participation/leadership needs to be happening at preschool and at the Scriber level, but there are many problems to solve before introducing parents to these programs.  In this caes, administration was ""tone deaf"" to the needs and recommendations outlined by staff who actually work in and envision the program. (I don't think this was actually the AECC principal, but administrators above or operating with that person).   -Transparency is essential if we do need to discuss budget issues.  That is preferable to not knowing and ""being told"" what do to do. "

We were also told that programs were 'full.'","At the two schools I worked at last year, the staff were AWESOME, both sped and gen-ed. They were the ones who held everything together while the ship was sinking.     My building principals were also outstanding, doing the job of 5 people and still maintaining order and consistency.","In my opinion, we are understaffed in regards to special education. Teachers are stretched thin, and it's extremely difficult to recruit, train, and retain quality paraprofessional candidates.  Teachers have little to no time to train para's.    My building principal is wonderful; very supportive of special ed staff and programs.      I felt deserted by district leadership.","Having the option to have IEP meetings over Zoom was/is a very popular option with my families.  It allows them to attend meetings and not worry about finding childcare, and they can attend while on break from work.  Sometimes coming into the physical school building can be intimidating, so being in a familiar place helps reduce barriers.     School newsletters are popular, my parents say they don't  always read the district newsletter but they rarely miss reading the newsletters sent from the schools their children attend.    Case managers have built up trust and relationships with families, we can get information out quickly and effectively when needed.",I don't know.,"I honestly don't know how to answer this.  Maybe it's a consistent staffing thing, like the person you went to last year with a certain question now no longer exists and/or the title has changed. It's hard to know who to go to for help. "
Yes,Yes,Special education teacher,,,,High school (grades 9-12),"Why providing students who have learning disabilities support, accommodation, and modifications is important.     Importance of attendance at IEP meetings.    Tools, base curricula, manipulatives, paras, and materials to supplement teaching students with disabilities.     Why thinking about students with special needs and disabilities is important while making school-wide decisions.     Importance of having accessible general education classes for students moving out of Learning Support or resource settings. This will support the federal Manadated LRE and increase success outside of the SpEd setting. ",,Accessible general education classes for students transitioning into a less restrictive environment. Having only honors classes and IB classes available keeps special education students in the most restrictive environment.     Different levels (like they have in general ed) of special education subjects. Not just throwing them all in a class at completely different levels and abilities. ,IB for all.

Yes,Yes,"Related service provider, psychologist, or other certificated specialist",,,,High school (grades 9-12),,,We have good admin team who care about students and want to do right by students.,"At our school, there are specific teachers and specific classes that special education case managers consistently place special education students in. These are the teachers who are great at working with special education students, or who are most likely to pass special education students. Many teachers, subjects, electives, etc, are avoided specifically because the case managers feel like the *teacher* does not work well with students with disabilities. That seems wrong to me. All teachers of all classes should be able to work with students with disabilities. That being said- teachers do need more support- more training, more para-educators in the classroom, etc, in order to make this happen.  As an example, many special education students at my school take Horticulture-sometimes two or three times, to meet their science requirement. That's because the teacher of Horticulture is amazing and works well with special education students, not because the students are interested in Horticulture. Special education students should be able to take other science classes that interest them, and should not all be placed in the class with the teacher that will accommodate them, work with them, or who they know will give them a passing grade. All teachers should be able to successfully work with special education students.    ",We have a weekly email from our admin and I read it.,"It can be tough to get a hold of parents.  Many times phone numbers are wrong, emails bounce back, etc.  However I also think many teachers are uneasy about calling home and avoid it. This creates more problems.  I am not sure what happened with Parent Square. I think many of us are confused. Are we supposed to be using it?  ","Perhaps if each team was connected with someone at the district office for their specific department, that would be helpful.

The process of having teachers ask building admin questions that are really for sped admin and then having the building admin have to get in touch with the sped admin and then report back to the teacher is ineffective and inefficient. The teachers should be able to speak directly with the admin who have the answers to their questions.,"There should be some protocols for rolling out information that start with district level admin, move to building admin, then to teacher and other school staff so that everyone knows what's happening, what they are responsible for, and what the people they supervise are responsible for.    In addition, there has been a great deal of damage done by a couple of toxic high level individuals in the student services department. I don't know that repair can be done there at this point.

While I know the goal is for most students to be in gen ed (and I agree that should be a goal), considering the level of support needed and the impact of this student, placement should have been discussed.
